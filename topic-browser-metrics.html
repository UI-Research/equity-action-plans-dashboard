<p>One of the cornerstones of DHS's approach to equity is a strong commitment to stakeholder and community engagement - to understand concerns about barriers faced by members of underserved communities in DHS's programs and to assess the effectiveness of DHS's efforts to address those barriers. Over the past year, DHS hosted engagements specific to the areas of focus in this plan. For example, in August 2022, the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) led a listening session to hear directly from Arab, Middle Eastern, Muslim, and South Asian (AMEMSA) faith - based and community leaders regarding civil rights and civil liberties concerns. The discussion focused on DHS policies and practices, particularly with respect to screening and redress. In February 2023, the Office of Partnership and Engagement (OPE) held a listening session with diverse faith leaders in Dearborn, Michigan to better understand the threat landscape and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">share</span> DHS information and resources.

<p>(1) Reduce barriers to citizenship and naturalization through continued evaluation of programs, policies, and outreach opportunities. There is a significant gap between the annual naturalization <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">rate</span> and the annual size of the population eligible to naturalize. Commonly cited barriers to naturalization include: a lack of understanding about the naturalization process; a real or perceived inability to meet the English language requirement that is part of the naturalization process; a lack of ability to pay application fees; and a lack of understanding about reduced fees and fee waiver options. To address these barriers, USCIS will strengthen efforts to promote naturalization through citizenship education and outreach, capacity building efforts, and more streamlined naturalization application services. (2) Promote equitable use of AI technology across the Department through the development and application of new guidance as well as intra - agency coordination. With increased use of AI in carrying out DHS's homeland security mission, members of underserved communities may face disproportionate or disparate impacts, such as additional scrutiny or denial of benefits based on the potential for algorithms to operate in a manner that exhibits inappropriate biases in violation of law and DHS policy. To address these barriers, DHS will implement Department - wide policy guidance regarding the equitable use and implementation of AI technology and leverage the ongoing work of the Artificial Intelligence Task Force (AITF) and other internal working groups to establish a framework for trustworthy and responsible AI. (3) Counter domestic violent extremism (DVE) and targeted violence through a public health - informed approach. As the Department continues to tackle DVE threats, members of certain underserved communities (e.g., AMEMSA, Jewish, LGBTQI + and Black communities) continue to have concerns about DVE threats that impact their communities. To address these barriers, DHS will build the capacity of prevention professionals, SO that they can better understand and use data - driven information on how underserved communities are often the targets and victims of domestic terrorists; </p></article>

USCIS held stakeholder engagements on January 12, March 3, April 28, and May 31, 2023, to address questions and gather feedback on the naturalization test redesign initiative. For FY 2023, USCIS scheduled and conducted in - person Adult Citizenship Education Training in areas where there are large numbers of LPRs who are eligible to naturalize and areas that are underserved. USCIS will continue to engage with the public, including members of underserved communities; relevant stakeholders; state and local government; and other federal agencies to seek input on ways to further advance equity in applying for naturalization. As part of this effort, USCIS will utilize its expanded cadre of citizenship ambassadors to <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">share</span> information about the naturalization process and how to access information and support. Further, CRCL, in collaboration with USCIS / NWG, will periodically disseminate messaging regarding citizenship and naturalization initiatives to CRCL's network of community stakeholders through the GovDelivery system and monthly CRCL newsletter with an audience of over 10,000 members of the public. Additionally, CRCL, in collaboration with USCIS / NWG, will host a series of Naturalization Test Redesign Information and Listening Sessions with CRCL's network of community stakeholders. (2) Promote equitable use of AI technology across the Department through the development and application of new guidance as well as intra - agency coordination. </p></article>

<p>DHS routinely engages with members of underserved communities regarding concerns related to targeted violence and domestic violent extremism. During these engagements, stakeholders have suggested strengthening and increasing DHS's communication about the public health - informed approach with communities that have expressed concern about prior prevention approaches. Existing literature proposes addressing violent extremism in a public health framework. This approach focuses on creating evidence - based prevention resources and helping prevention providers build protective factors at the individual, family, and community levels to <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">decrease</span> the risk of targeted violence, such as school or workplace violence, premeditated hate - fueled violence, and terrorism.

<p>advisory councils and committees, and uncertainty that DHS would pursue modifications to unfair practices that might require legislative fixes. To address these barriers, DHS will conduct a review of contract opportunities and grant funding opportunity announcements prior to release to determine how equitable access for tribes can be furthered; examine policy and procedures to identify updates in furtherance of security and the appropriate handling of sacred, ceremonial, or cultural items and conduct training on the same; pursue adequate staffing and other resources where needed to ensure equitable service delivery; ensure Tribal representation in DHS advisory councils, committees, and other groups; and pursue modifications to service delivery, including where legislative fixes are needed. (7) Advance equity for persons seeking humanitarian protection during immigration processing by strengthening programs available to assist them. Stakeholders continue to report concerns about processing delays and access to resources. To address these barriers, USCIS will enhance processing efficiency by leveraging technology, increasing access, and seeking opportunities to reduce fees; and DHS will strengthen resources for non - detained noncitizens released on an alternative to detention program and create process efficiencies across the board.

(9) Advance equity through Community Disaster Resilience Zones. FEMA's National Advisory Council has found that smaller, less affluent communities with fewer resources cannot access funding to appropriately prepare for a disaster, which leads to inadequate response and recovery and little opportunity for mitigation. To address this barrier, FEMA will enhance and expand Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) Program technical assistance; implement Benefit - Cost Analysis (BCA) enhancements for all relevant mitigation programs, including incorporating equity weights into BCA; and develop a Recovery and Resilience Resource Portal, which provides ideas and information on available funding opportunities for state, local, Tribal, and territorial (SLTT) partners and community decision - makers. </p></article>

<p>Benefit applicants, both overseas and domestic, sometimes have difficulty attending USCIS appointments when the distance needed to travel is long. There are barriers related to transportation, health and safety, and finances. In FY 2023, USCIS's Refugee, Asylum, and International Operations (RAIO) began increasing the use of video technology to conduct I - 589 asylum interviews domestically, and I - 590 refugee interviews internationally, SO that applicants living in remote locations will not have to wait SO long or travel SO far. USCIS is currently drafting a proposed rule that would codify RAIO's flexibility to conduct remote interviews with refugee applicants abroad. In March 2023, USCIS published an extension to the Asylum Interpreter Temporary Final Rule (TFR) that allowed USCIS to provide telephonic interpreters for asylum applicants who speak one of 47 listed languages through September 12, 2023. Telephonic interpreters can also be connected to video interviews SO that remote interviews can be completed. The TFR temporarily reduced barriers for asylum applicants to attend and complete their interviews. There is a significant backlog of pending petitions for U nonimmigrant status due, in part, to the annual statutory cap limiting approvals to 10,000 principal petitions per fiscal year. As this backlog of over 250,000 filings are solely <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">filed</span> via paper and postal mail, USCIS is considering ways to leverage technology to improve processing to provide Employment Authorization Documents and deferred action for U petitioners and their derivatives with pending filings. As noted in the U.S. National Plan to End Gender - Based Violence, immigrant survivors face increased barriers to economic stability. They often encounter delayed processing times when applying for special immigration remedies for GBV victims that were established through VAWA and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, such as the VAWA self - petition, the U nonimmigrant status for eligible victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and qualifying eligible crimes, and the T nonimmigrant status for eligible victims of a severe form of trafficking in persons. Delays in access to work authorization and public benefits for which an individual is potentially eligible, such as housing assistance or health care, can <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">increase</span> vulnerabilities to abuse and undermine recovery and healing. For refugees living in many parts of the world to access the US Refugee Admissions Program, they need to be interviewed and processed by USCIS while they are overseas, which presents many logistical and travel challenges for both the refugees and USCIS staff. When USCIS has no permanent presence in a geographic area, processing occurs when USCIS has the staff to make several international trips to complete different processing steps, thereby increasing the processing time. There are numerous steps involved in processing benefits for refugee populations, such as medical exams, refugee interviews, finalization of the decision, and assurances for placement with domestic resettlement agencies. These steps typically take place sequentially and may take a long time in between steps. Noncitizen workers are particularly vulnerable to workplace abuses including unpaid wages, discrimination, health and safety violations, and reprisals for seeking to improve working conditions. In addition, noncitizen workers are often afraid to report violations to labor enforcement agencies or participate in labor standards investigations for fear of immigration - related retaliation or threats of deportation by their employers. </p></article>

<p>Reduce barriers to humanitarian benefits by leveraging technology, increasing access, enhancing process efficiencies, and seeking opportunities to reduce fees. Strengthen resources for non - detained noncitizens released on an alternative to detention by building on existing case management programs, like the Case Management Pilot Program, which provides case management, legal information and screening, trafficking screening, and connection to a range of social services, including pro se counsel, to noncitizens on ATD. As enumerated in DHS's National Action Plan to implement the Gender Policy Council Strategy, USCIS and ICE will work to expand access to T and U nonimmigrant statuses and VAWA protections. These benefits offer critical protection for many of our most vulnerable noncitizens - those who have been victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons and other specified crimes, and those who are victims of battery or extreme cruelty by an abusive spouse or other family member. All three benefits are crucial in stabilizing victims by providing a potential pathway to lawful permanent residence. The Department will explore how to prevent instances of domestic abuse, gender - based violence, human trafficking, and other criminal activity by raising awareness of and expanding access to potentially eligible noncitizens, including women of color, who may be particularly vulnerable. USCIS leads this effort and has set goals to guide its backlog - <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">reduction</span> efforts.

In response to a wave of bomb threats targeting Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in 2022, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Office for Bombing Prevention (OBP) conducted 27 courses for HBCU students and faculty in prevention and building resilience, trained more than 1,200 participants, delivered over 1,500 products, and saw a 54 <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">percent</span> <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">increase</span> in the more than 24,000 training video completions. Additional courses are ongoing. In 2022, CRCL, the DHS Office of State and Local Law Enforcement (OSLLE), and the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity through HBCUs, sponsored full - day courses at five HBCUs to help equip campus leaders and other community stakeholders with the problem - solving skills to prevent, protect, and mitigate the effects of, respond to, and recover from active shooter situations. Since July 2022, DHS has led multiple engagements focused on addressing community concerns related to DVE, Department strategy, and incidents of hate targeting specific communities. In April 2023, OPE hosted a virtual Ramadan engagement with American Muslim community leaders to solicit their feedback, concerns, and insights on DHS policies and programs. In March 2023, DHS launched the Prevention Resource Finder, providing stakeholders with information on the resources needed to help prepare for and prevent targeted violence and terrorism across our country. 5. Filing Complaints and Seeking Redress in DHS Programs and Activities. DHS continues to enhance communication with the public regarding the ability to file complaints concerning DHS programs and seek redress without retaliation, how these processes work, and what individuals can expect from these processes. OPE, CRCL, and the DHS Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO) continue to hold engagement events for the public, including underserved communities, to provide more information about the various DHS complaint processes. In March 2023, CRCL launched a new online complaint portal, with prompts available in 10 languages. The portal accepts complaints in any language and also notes the availability of interpreters and translators for any language. In accordance with Section 9 (c) of Executive Order 14074, Advancing Effective Accountable Policing and Criminal Justice Practices to Enhance Public Trust and Public Safety, DHS law enforcement agencies will continue to ensure that effective </p></article>

<p>6. Airport Screening. In furtherance of TSA's mission to protect the Nation's transportation systems and facilitate lawful travel, TSA has enhanced and standardized training for its screening officers and has improved its screening technology capabilities to reduce the possibility of bias against travelers and <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">increase</span> safety. TSA deployed new Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) software for screening systems at airports across the country. This update eliminates the need for Transportation Security Officers to determine a passenger's gender prior to AIT screening and is projected to reduce the instances of enhanced screening for transgender persons and members of other underserved communities. TSA has held multiple community engagements to enhance communication with the traveling public and <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">increase</span> awareness of security procedures. 7. Trusted Traveler Programs. DHS has taken steps to advance equity in its Trusted Traveler Programs. TSA updated the PreCheck application process by allowing individuals to select their gender marker based on self - attestation, regardless of sex assigned at birth. The application was updated to include additional gender marker options to better serve non - binary and gender non - conforming travelers. 8. Public Assistance. FEMA has advanced equity as a foundation for public assistance. In August 2022, FEMA's Office for Public Assistance released the Operational Draft of the Public Assistance Program Delivery Guide, which included considerations for FEMA recipients and applicants to conduct response and recovery efforts in an equitable manner. The Guide includes a performance metric for the prioritization of communities rated as highly socially vulnerable, including underserved rural areas. From April 2021 through August 2022, FEMA's Office for Equal Rights worked with the Office for Public Assistance on its mission to ensure an equitable response to the COVID - 19 pandemic. FEMA established the Civil Rights Advisory Group as part of the agency's commitment to the COVID - 19 vaccination mission amid the ongoing battle against the pandemic. The advisory group's mission is to evaluate the policies, practices, strategies, and plans in place to ensure equity in vaccine access and administration. 9. Achieving Equitable Outcomes for Disaster Survivors. FEMA continues to advance equitable outcomes for disaster survivors. FEMA is working to identify and include considerations for traditionally underserved or marginalized communities in the forms, processes, and online Grants Portal system that the agency uses to support applicants. </p></article>

<p>FEMA is redeveloping the way it collects, documents, and processes information from applicants to be less burdensome, more effective, and more equitable in the distribution of Public Assistance. Moving forward, FEMA will work to clarify the recipient's legal responsibility and to structure a more comprehensive reporting process SO that recipients and subrecipients clearly understand their obligations to develop and report on their strategies for equitable response and recovery. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) selected Recovering from a Disaster as a Life Experience Project in 2022. Discovery work was completed to inform how FEMA could create an equitable and less frustrating experience to survivors while they are enduring trauma. Based on recommendations made from the discovery work, the General Services Administration is currently partnering with FEMA to measure end - to - end burden placed on natural disaster survivors. 10. Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP). NSGP provides funding for physical security enhancements to nonprofit organizations, including houses of worship, that are at high risk of terrorist attack. FEMA has improved equitable access to NSGP funding by improving participation from nonprofit organizations serving underserved communities and embedding equity considerations in the grant review process. FEMA continues to engage in robust outreach and engagement efforts throughout the NSGP lifecycle to ensure that nonprofit organizations have the information they need to apply. In FY 2022, NSGP held 82 events, including webinars, with over 18,039 unique participants to <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">increase</span> understanding of the application process and eligibility for subrecipients. In June 2023, FEMA published an informative video about applying to the NSGP, available both on YouTube.com and FEMA.gov. FEMA has collaborated with other federal and nonprofit partners to further amplify this engagement and messaging, including the DHS Center for Faith - Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, Department of Justice (DOJ) Community Relations Service, religious and cultural organizations, HBCUs, and Minority Serving Institutions. In FY 2023, FEMA advanced considerations of equity in awarding NSGP grant funding by adding up to 15 additional points to the scores of organizations that demonstrate how they serve an underserved community or population or that are located within an underserved community. Additionally, applicants who had never received NSGP funding had 15 points added to their project score (a scoring metric continued from FY 2022). </p></article>

Research shows that productivity gains may be the greatest when low - wage workers are provided with adequate care options. Further, disruptions to childcare are more common among lower - income and lower - socially supported mothers. Education and labor market outcomes remain inequitable. Research shows that students do not receive sufficient information about what careers are available and which courses best lead to those options, so they waste time in courses that do not lead to good jobs. For example, not all students graduate from high school, and even when they do, most are ineligible for their postsecondary training program of choice. </p></article>

<p>EDA's Good Jobs Challenge (GJC). This program is expected to train and place 50,000 people in good jobs. GJC meets participants where they are - which includes flexible course scheduling, hands - on training, and curriculum directly aligned to jobs available in their field of training. All 32 awardees received funding to support wraparound services and have plans for how to use services to improve outcomes for participants who would have otherwise struggled to access training and job opportunities. Grantees have allocated millions of dollars to ensure participants can access to childcare, transportation, English language learning, etc. GJC also has awardees that support the workforce needs of underserved populations and areas, communities of color, women, and other groups facing labor market barriers such as persons with disabilities, disconnected youth, individuals in recovery, individuals with past criminal records including justice - impacted and reentry participants, trainees participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and Women, Infants and Children (WIC), and veterans. EDA's Recompete Pilot Program. With over 4,000 communities eligible for the pilot, the program will invest $ 200 million in organizations committed to creating and connecting workers in persistently distressed communities to good jobs while ensuring the economic benefits are equitably allocated. Unique amongst EDA's national competitions, Recompete is designed to be exclusively targeted towards those communities grappling with persistent economic distress, with equity at its core. The Phase 1 NOFO application deadline closed on October 2023, and EDA received 565 applications - the highest <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 102, 255, 0.3)" title="outcome">number of</span> submissions of out any national competition to - date.

To achieve this goal, the Department is promoting the goal through large implementation programs, working with other agencies to do the same, and highlighting commitments from Labor and the private sector to launch complementary efforts. In July 2023, the Secretary hired a Senior Advisor for Women in Construction to oversee this initiative. Through the Internet for All program, Commerce will promote increased outreach to recruit women in broadband construction. NTIA's BEAD program requires states and territories to develop workforce plans that include strategies to ensure the job opportunities created will be available to a diverse pool of workers, including women and people of color. Through the CHIPS NOFO for commercial facilities, applicants are asked to describe how they will recruit, hire, and retain a diverse and skilled construction workforce, including efforts to include women and other economically disadvantaged individuals in the construction industry. Additionally, the CHIPS NOFO for commercial fabrication facilities requires applicants requesting over $ 150 million in direct funding to provide a plan for access to child care for facility and construction workers. This will expand access to training opportunities and enable workers to fully participate in these high - quality, good - paying jobs. </p></article>

<p>EERE released its HBCU Clean Energy Education Prize during May 2023. This competition, with $ 7.75M in cash prizes, will help HBCU institutions develop programming to strengthen the participation of K - 12 and community college students in STEM and other associated fields that can lead to potential careers in clean energy industries. It will also give HBCUs the opportunity to create enhanced curricula and programs that will provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and establish partnerships that lead to career opportunities in clean energy. This prize supports President Biden's Justice40 Initiative, which directs 40 % of the overall benefits of certain federal investments to flow to disadvantaged communities, by helping to build a diverse STEM pipeline to support the clean energy transition. The prize aims to help HBCUs achieve these goals through two distinct prize tracks, the Inspire Track and the Partnerships Track. HBCUs of all sizes are invited to apply to help foster the next generation of the clean energy technical workforce. Details can be found at the Prize website: HBCU Clean Energy Education Prize HeroX. In FY 2023, EERE's first cohort of 11 students from the Graduate Education for Minority Students fellowship (GEM Fellowship) program, a non - governmental program, started their 10 - week summer internship assignments in various EERE program offices. The goal of the GEM Fellowship program is to enhance the value of the Nation's human capital by increasing the participation of underrepresented groups at the master's and doctoral levels in engineering and science. The FY 2023 program follows EERE's pilot program, which established GEM Fellow cohorts in a partnership pilot between EERE's Building Technologies Office and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. This is the first class of GEM Fellowship students within DOE. EERE's Interagency Agreement with the Army and the MSI STEM R & D Consortium was designed to <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">increase</span> funding opportunities for MSIs.

<p>EERE is partnering with the Office of Energy Justice and Equity and NREL to develop STEM faculty from MSIs through the Faculty - Applied Clean Energy Science (FACES) program. The FACES pilot program offers a unique opportunity to foster the <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">growth</span> of STEM faculty from MSIs through exposure to the National Lab systems. By providing valuable on - site experiences, fostering collaboration, and developing scalable educational modules, the program aims to expand DOE funding opportunities for MSI faculty. EERE announced six grand prize winners of the Inclusive Energy Innovation Prize on June 15, 2023. The prize seeks to foster a just and equitable clean energy future by investing in community - led innovation and entrepreneurship programs in areas historically underserved by federal funding. The winning teams in this first - of - its - kind competition received $ 250,000 each for their entrepreneurship, job - training, mentorship, and other solutions to expand clean energy and economic opportunities in underserved communities. The Community Clean Energy Coalition Prize recognized and assisted coalitions supporting underrepresented communities with a prize pool of $ 2.1 million to build capacity and address local energy challenges with clean energy solutions in line with the Justice40 Initiative. EERE announced successful completion of the prize on December 7, 2023. All ten coalitions participating in the prize successfully completed all three phases of the challenge and were awarded $ 205k each in aggregate. The top three coalitions were awarded additional prize bonuses ranging from $ 10k to $ 50k for the strength of their project implementation and vision for the future. The Community Energy Innovation Prize launched in November 2023 is the successor to both DOE's Inclusive Energy Innovation Prize and Community Clean Energy Coalition Prize. The prize program will award up to $ 7.5 million in cash prizes as well as mentorship opportunities to organizations supporting innovation, entrepreneurship, capacity building, and economic development in communities historically underrepresented in climate and energy technology funding. The expanded prize has three tracks: clean energy ecosystem track, manufacturing ecosystem track, and collegiate track. </p></article>

DOE created the Office of State and Community Energy Programs to administer state and community - facing programs, including the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP). The following bullets outline key accomplishments in WAP since the publication of the April 2022 EAP. On February 3, 2023, DOE published allocations of $ 30M for Weatherization Readiness from the FY 2023 WAP appropriation, an <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">increase</span> of $ 15M from FY 2022. DOE WAP and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) launched a Weatherization Workforce Development Pilot in February 2023 to enhance impact in four communities: Lowell, MA; Roanoke, VA; Chicago, IL; and Warner Robins, GA. The program connects HUD residents to weatherization jobs within Community Action Agencies and sets up residents for careers in green construction. This partnership aims to support the utilization of DOE Weatherization Assistance Program funds by adequately staffing the weatherization programs in local communities. Several of the communities have begun hosting job fairs to <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">share</span> information and recruit HUD residents interested in weatherization work. Sustainable Energy Resources for Consumers (SERC) funding is available to WAP grantees, subgrantees, and non - profit organizations to demonstrate innovative technologies and approaches that go beyond the scope of the formula WAP. These grants offer more flexibility than the WAP formula grants and unique opportunities to broaden the impact of WAP. The second round of SERC funding was announced in October 2022. DOE anticipates awarding eleven grantees $ 17M with 2023 SERC funds. The projects will install various renewables, including solar technologies and heat pumps. In June 2022, DOE published WPN 22 - 9, Managing Multiple Funding Streams. This policy update provides clarification on the allowability of braiding DOE funds with other federal and non - federal funding sources to expand and enhance the services provided to low - income households. </p></article>

<p>DOE / OMB / OFPP co - sponsored two nation - wide crowdsourcing campaigns in 2021, which illustrated that underserved groups faced difficulty finding DOE financial assistance opportunities. High participation at DOE - hosted Annual Small Business Fora & Expos illustrates that small businesses, including those in underserved communities, are very interested in working with the Department and are seeking clarity on opportunities, procurement (and other funding mechanisms) processes and procedures, and subcontracting opportunities. Through involvement in numerous annual regional / local small business opportunity outreach events and conversations with business owners, DOE learned that small businesses are highly capable of performing DOE mission work that is generally less complex in nature and smaller in dollar value.

<p>Although inconsistent, several offices across DOE have collected R & D impact metrics, such as the <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 102, 255, 0.3)" title="outcome">number of</span> peer - reviewed journal articles, patents, licenses, new companies formed, and the amount of follow - on funding received from the private sector. Challenges to these current efforts include: Many of these achievements occur after a project is closed out, when awardees are no longer reporting on the project and have likely moved onto other projects. As a result, many of these outputs are not appropriately attributed to DOE funding. One study of the Web of Science - a public database of scientific articles - found that in some subject areas, as little as 28 % of the articles had any acknowledgements, and of those only 65 % acknowledged funding. 9 If funding is properly acknowledged, web - crawling techniques can be used to extract subsequent impacts. Existing project impact metrics fail to address equity or justice. There are infrequent third - party reviews of evaluation metrics. These reviews are costly, time - intensive, and limited by confidential business information restrictions. There is limited interaction and participation with citizen / community science in the development of DOE R & D strategies and metrics. There have been several approaches across the federal Government to address the foregoing challenges: In the Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA - E), there are staff who follow up with past recipients to collect research outputs / publications. In the DOE Office of Science, there is an annual automated reminder to past awardees to update their profile, including information regarding publications. Existing literature shows a lack of equity consideration in R & D metrics. To fill this gap, NREL developed the Justice Underpinning Science and Technology Research (JUST - R) metrics framework - energy justice metrics specifically targeted at early - stage research. 10 Some offices have project - specific metrics. For example, DOE's Building Technology Office requires applicants of some FOAs to provide estimates of energy, cost, and emissions savings using the Resilient and Efficient Codes Implementation (RECI) Impact Calculator tool - a spreadsheet - based tool for building code updates in new construction, improvements to existing buildings, and improvements in energy codes compliance. 11 Since climate <span style="background-color: rgba(204, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="progress">change</span> disproportionately impacts low - income and minority </p></article>

The Working Group has focused on Partnership Intermediary Agreements (PIAs) and Other Transactions (OT) Authority as possible pathways to reach underrepresented entities and communities. PIAs are best utilized when traditional contractual mechanisms do not provide adequate outreach with non - traditional contractors and can reduce barriers to entry for such entities. DOE has put a Pilot PIA agreement in place to extend the Department's reach to new entrants and non - traditional partners, as well as small business firms, universities, and non - profit organizations. The agency has awarded one project utilizing the PIA mechanism, and additional projects are in the planning phase. Additionally, the agency has developed an OT guide for DOE program offices to <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">increase</span> the utilization of OT Authorities department wide.

<p>In FY 2022, SC launched Reaching a New Energy Sciences Workforce (RENEW) to establish a more targeted and intentional approach to building foundations to support undergraduate and graduate student training opportunities and support institutions historically underrepresented in the SC research portfolio. RENEW leverages the agency's unique National Laboratories, user facilities, and other research infrastructures to provide training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty. In FY 2022, SC announced 41 RENEW awards totaling $ 32M to 37 institutions, including 24 MSIs. In FY 2023, SC issued seven RENEW solicitations and awarded $ 70M in funding to 65 institutions, including 40 MSIs. In FY 2023, SC launched the Funding for Accelerated, Inclusive Research Initiative to build research capacity, infrastructure, and expertise at non - R1 institutions and support mutually beneficial relationships between MSIs and Emerging Research Institutions and partner institutions. SC has announced $ 37M in funding for 52 projects to 44 institutions to perform basic research in applied mathematics, biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, geoscience, isotope research, materials science, and physics. As a result of SC's increased outreach and engagement with MSI communities and support for funding mechanisms aimed at increasing MSI participation, SC significantly increased the participation of MSIs as lead institutions in its funding opportunities in FY 2022 over FY 2021 levels. For example: SC more than doubled the <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 102, 255, 0.3)" title="outcome">number of</span> research grants to HBCUs as the lead institution in FY 2022 (from 15 awards in FY 2021 to 35 awards in FY 2022). </p></article>

<p>SC nearly doubled the level of funding support for research awards to Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) from FY 2021 levels (from $ 58.0M in FY 2021 to $ 109.0M in FY 2022). SC nearly doubled the <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 102, 255, 0.3)" title="outcome">number of</span> new awards to HSIs in FY 2022 (from 71 awards in FY 2021 to 136 awards in FY 2022). In FY 2023, SC established a requirement that all research proposals submitted to SC include a plan for Promoting Inclusive and Equitable Research (PIER). PIER Plans describe the strategies and activities the applicants will incorporate into their research projects to promote opportunity, inclusion, and access to STEM research and training for individuals from all backgrounds. PIER Plans are evaluated as part of the merit review process. Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM) FECM is collaborating with National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) acquisition professionals to embed societal and community impact criteria into FOAs - whether mandated by BIL or IRA, or program directed - that expand the pool of new entrants (e.g., MSIs) participating in program procurement, acquisition, and development activities. FECM's University Training and Research (UTR) program supports novel, early - stage research at U.S. colleges and universities, with an emphasis on student training. The UTR program has a sub - program dedicated to supporting projects specifically at HBCUs and other MSIs; in FY 2023, FECM made 18 awards totaling more than $ 7M with nearly half (10 awards) going to MSIs (totaling nearly $ 3.5M). (See University Training and Research netl.doe.gov.) FECM held a workshop (April 2023) for potential future grant applicants to provide information about the UTR program and the associated application process. Over 90 people from educational institutions participated. In June 2023, FECM announced up to $ 17.7M in available funding (FOA 3002) for five different areas of interest, including establishing multi - institution collaborations for student exchanges from MSIs, new academic curricula related to geosciences, supporting interdisciplinary training in humanities - driven STEM fields. </p></article>

<p>Revise Departmental and Bureau policies to make environmental justice considerations an essential part of the decision - making process, which will help shape program development and implementation to have a greater focus on environmental justice. Examples include: Update the Department's environmental justice policy as stated in the Departmental Manual to reflect EO 14008, entitled " " Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad " " and EO 14096, entitled " " Revitalizing Our Nations Commitment to Environmental Justice for All. " " Create guidance documents for the use of science and data in environmental decision - making to incorporate data related to environmental justice and Indigenous Knowledge, along with an environmental justice science and data integrated decision model. This work, which helps address the Department's priority learning question: " " How well does DOI collect and document traditional knowledge that informs decisions? " ", which is based on feedback received at numerous listening sessions and through public comments that will result in more equitable outcomes by ensuring that the voices of Indigenous communities and communities with environmental justice concerns are part of the decision - making process. The BLM issued an " " Instruction Memorandum about Environmental Justice Implementation " " and " " Addressing Environmental Justice in NEPA FAQs " " in September 2022. These documents update and formalize best practices while recommending methods for scoping, outreach, and analysis in environmental reviews. These policies will help guide BLM staff in implementing environmental justice and Justice40 Initiative and will serve as examples for other Bureaus to develop policies. Expand outreach and assistance efforts to better meet the needs of underserved communities. Priority learning question 4.4 in the Department's FY 2022 - 2026 Learning Agenda asked, " " How can the Department <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">increase</span> stakeholder engagement to improve environmental justice outcomes for infrastructure investments? " " Examples include: Develop a stakeholder relationship management platform to reduce stakeholder fatigue and help staff across the Department learn about the needs communities identify during engagements and consultations. This will lead to more equitable outcomes by increasing the effectiveness and usefulness of engagements. Provide technical assistance for grant writing and grant writers, which we have learned from listening sessions and public comment is an important tool for reducing the barriers to participating in funding opportunities. Work with on - the - ground partners that can help guide and direct our outreach to communities who need it most. For example, the Office of Native Hawaiian Relations has been working with certain Native Hawaiian Organizations (NHOs) that have facilitated outreach to other NHOs and portions of the community that have not historically applied for or received funding from the Department due to capacity issues or other barriers to participation.

<p>The DOI provided $ 46 million in funding to Tribal communities to address the unique impacts of climate <span style="background-color: rgba(204, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="progress">change</span> in Indigenous communities. This initial funding from President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and FY 2022 appropriations funded projects and initiatives address and strengthen climate resilience and adaptation; ocean and coastal management; community - driven relocation and protect - in - place activities; and internships and youth engagement. The DOI announced $ 8.5 million in grant awards by the Office of Insular Affairs ' Energizing Insular Communities program to support energy initiatives in the U.S. Territories. This award included $ 1 million to the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority for the procurement of hybrid and electric utility fleet vehicles and equipment, and $ 1 million to the American Samoa Medical Center Authority for microgrid, cooling tower, and LED lighting retrofit projects. The Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) modified the evaluation criteria for WaterSMART grants to encourage projects that directly benefit disadvantaged communities and support climate <span style="background-color: rgba(204, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="progress">change</span> resiliency. The NPS announced $ 192 million in funding for the LWCF - Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership Program (ORLP), which enables urban, disadvantaged communities to (1) create new outdoor recreation spaces, (2) reinvigorate existing parks, and (3) form connections between people and the outdoors in such communities. As part of the notice of funding opportunity, NPS modified the evaluation criteria in ORLP grants to encourage States to submit projects focused on environmental justice, addressing heat islands, and support for recreation outside of military facilities. The NPS also created two deadlines for the grant - January 23, 2023, and May 31, 2023 - to encourage States to submit more grants. In standing up the BIL Orphaned Oil and Gas Wells Federal Program, DOI established evaluation criteria to prioritize disadvantaged communities, and ensure projects identify and address any disproportionate burden of adverse human health or environmental effects of orphaned wells on communities of color, low - income communities, and Tribal and Indigenous communities. C. Additional Efforts to Advance Equity The DOI launched a Women's Mentoring Program in 2022 to provide a platform for Department employees who would benefit from accessing a women - centered space. With a mission of fostering meaningful relationships through mentorships in which women build knowledge, confidence, leadership, and skills, this program is run by volunteers. It also addresses Federal workforce gender inequalities and supports the administration's National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality. The Department's procurement staff and Office of the Solicitor collaborated to develop a vendor communications guidance document. This guidance addresses issues identified during public engagement. Specifically, the guidance seeks to improve how information is conveyed to unsuccessful offerors after award. Such meaningful communication supports new entrants and other small and disadvantaged businesses in learning about Government contracting, grow as a business, and being better poised to submit competitive proposals for future acquisitions. </p></article>

<p>A. 2022 Equity Action Plan Update Pursuant to EO 13985, 2 the Department of Justice published its first ever Equity Action Plan in April 2022. Since then, the Department has made significant progress implementing its equity priorities by improving solicitation processes, increasing opportunities for disadvantaged small businesses located in Historically Underutilized Business Zones, and strengthening mechanisms for community engagement, among others. Specific examples of the Department's ongoing progress in advancing its 2022 equity priorities include: Strengthening efforts to ensure compliance and enforcement of non - discrimination laws. Following review of implementation and administrative enforcement of the non - discrimination provisions set forth in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act ³ and the Safe Streets Act4 in connection with Federal financial assistance, the Department is taking affirmative steps to improve this work. 5 For example, the Civil Rights Division (CRT) and the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) created and co - chair a Compliance Working Group to coordinate the implementation and enforcement of these statutes, issue public guidance, revise internal standards, update tools and resources, and conduct public outreach. 6 Enhancing language access for individuals with limited English proficiency. In May 2022, DOJ hired its first - ever Language Access Coordinator (Coordinator). Since then, DOJ's Coordinator has reestablished the Language Access Working Group, which meets regularly, is comprised of representatives from various DOJ components, and provides a platform to support, guide, and oversee components ' efforts to <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">increase</span> meaningful access SO that communities can better access DOJ programs, communicate public safety concerns, and vindicate their rights. For example, DOJ recently published its FY 2022 - 2026 Strategic Plan in Spanish and key excerpts were published in Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, and Tagalog. In August 2023, the Department also released its updated Language Access Plan, which improves translation and interpretation services, promotes quality assurance of those services, and expands the range of tools available to serve the public. The Department has made significant progress in advancing environmental justice as measured through the agency's performance on the Environmental Justice Scorecard. This progress includes: (1) analyzing how to best enforce the non - discrimination provisions under Title VI; (2) prioritizing environmental justice in DOJ's decision - making processes through the creation of the Office of Environmental Justice (OEJ), development and implementation of a new Comprehensive Environmental Justice Enforcement Strategy, and engagement with communities with environmental justice concerns, including Tribal nations; and (3) institutionalizing environmental justice by developing DOJ resources and training, increasing staff capacity, and strengthening </p></article>

These businesses are half as likely as non - minority counterparts to be fully approved for loans, lines of credit, and cash advances. 4 Minority - owned businesses and small disadvantaged businesses often have inadequate bonding capacity and access to surety expertise. This makes it difficult to compete and perform in government contracts, which limits award opportunities for many small, disadvantaged businesses. 5 </p></article>

<p>Measuring the effectiveness of public involvement is challenging and time - consuming. 13 The practical methods that have been developed to evaluate the success of public involvement activities often fall short of being able to measure the effectiveness of engagement activities and have not yet been applied at large scale.

<p>Education can have a transformational impact on an individual's life - and education plays a vital role in easing an individual's reentry from jail or prison back into society. Studies have found that a postsecondary education helps justice - impacted people who were formerly incarcerated find jobs upon release, support their families, and contribute positively to their communities. Research also shows that access to education in prison lowers the odds of recidivating by 43 <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">percent</span> and saves taxpayers up to $ 5 for every $ 1 spent. 26 However, policies have traditionally exacerbated the barriers that incarcerated people face when attempting to continue their education, including inadequate funding, local labor market trends and employer needs, statutory and administrative restrictions, and a lack of incentives and support to promote participation in education. 27 </p></article>

<p>Funding: Postsecondary institutions serving larger proportions of students of color and low - income students receive less funding per student on average than other institutions, such that four - year institutions serving larger proportions of Black students and Pell Grant recipients only spend half as much on instructional expenditures per student compared to other institutions. 8 These funding inequalities are due in part to state policies that provide more funding to more selective, research - intensive public institutions than the less - selective public four - year universities and community colleges that students of color and low - income students are more likely to attend. This is also due to the concentration of these student populations in states with lower higher education expenditures overall, particularly in the South. 9 Completion: While completion rates have increased modestly overall in recent years, about one - third of students starting in four - year institutions do not complete their degrees within six years, and about two - thirds of students starting at two - year institutions do not complete their credentials within three years. Double - digit gaps in completion rates remain between students of color and white students (e.g., a 22 - percentage point gap between Black and white students) and low - income and high - income students (e.g., a 22 - percentage point gap between Pell Grant recipients and non - recipients) in four - year institutions.

<p>Accessibility: Research has shown that students who complete the FAFSA are much more likely to enroll (and continue to re - enroll) in college, reducing enrollment " " melt " " especially during the summer between high school and college. 14 However, surveys have found that 10 <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">percent</span> of students did not fill out a FAFSA because they found the forms too complicated, and that a quarter of Black students and one - third of Hispanic or Latino students who did not file a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA ®) didn't have the information needed to finish it.

<p>1. Prioritized college access and college completion as accessibility, affordability, equitable funding, and verification remain barriers to postsecondary education. Improved Accessibility: In the wake of the Supreme Court ruling last summer limiting the ability of colleges to consider an applicant's race in and of itself as a factor in deciding whether to admit an applicant, the Department provided colleges and universities with resources on what admissions practices and programs remain lawful to ensure diversity, convened a National Summit on Educational Opportunity, and released a report on strategies for increasing diversity and educational opportunity. The Department also awarded over $ 40 million in Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) and TRIO Upward Bound grants in FY23 for programs focused on helping low - income students, first - generation students, and students with disabilities gain access to college. Improved Affordability: The Department worked to secure a $ 500 hundred <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">increase</span> in the maximum Pell Grant award, the largest <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">increase</span> in 10 years, in the FY23 Omnibus Appropriations bill and awarded $ 22 million in grants to colleges to address students ' basic needs, including food, housing, transportation, and childcare earlier this fiscal year.

<p>Black, Indigenous, and people of color, 21 individuals with disabilities, 22 and LGBTQI + persons2 23 are overrepresented in the criminal justice system. These trends of criminal justice system involvement and incarceration represent a serious and stubborn set of challenges to equal and equitable participation in high - quality education by all segments of society. Educational attainment of people who are incarcerated or confined and justice - impacted learners is incredibly important. Unfortunately, many people in prison lack the education and workforce skills they need to succeed in the labor market. Fifty - eight <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">percent</span> of people who are incarcerated do not complete an education program while in prison. 24 Limited - skilled individuals caught up in the incarceration cycle may not be able to access educational programs. Given that education is an important determinant of social and economic well - being, 25 it is critical to reconnect this population to educational opportunities. Investments in rehabilitative measures can help facilitate the successful completion of secondary education, as well as transitions to postsecondary education and the labor market. </p></article>

<p>Promote greater transparency about student participation in CTE. For the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 (Perkins V), which distributes $ 1.4 billion annually to states to support and improve CTE at the secondary and postsecondary levels, the Department collects data from states on student participation in CTE programs within 16 career clusters that are disaggregated by race, ethnicity, gender, and " " special population " " status. 35 These data have previously been disseminated as large static tables that have made it difficult to identify patterns of segregation and underrepresentation by students with different demographic characteristics. The Department will begin to supplement these tables with a dynamic, web - based data dashboard that will make clear the extent to which there is underrepresentation in different program areas by race, ethnicity, gender, and " " special population " " status at the national and state levels. Investigate collecting more data to support intersectional analyses. The Department will hold listening sessions with representatives of state agencies, civil rights organizations, and other stakeholders to explore expanding its collection of data on student participation in CTE by career cluster to data that are disaggregated by gender within each major racial and ethnic group and " " special population " " to support intersectional analyses. Participation data are now disaggregated by gender, race, ethnicity, and " " special population " " status only. Highlight state progress in reducing segregation by gender. State - reported data show that female and male participation in CTE programs in career clusters in which the other gender predominates varies widely across states, suggesting that the participation of students in programs that are non - traditional for their gender is highly dependent on the state and local context in which CTE programs in these clusters are implemented.

To carry out its mission, EPA is committed to developing and implementing concrete policies and activities to advance equity and environmental justice across its programs. This can only be <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">achieved</span> by acknowledging that many communities across the country have not sufficiently benefitted from EPA's decades of progress in reducing pollution and breaking down barriers to equity.

EPA's commitment to equity and environmental justice forms a critical foundation on which to build meaningful engagement with communities with environmental justice concerns; achieve more equitable and just outcomes, including pollution reductions in communities with environmental justice concerns; and deliver other tangible benefits. In remaining faithful to these commitments, EPA is living up to the promise to protect human health and the environment made to all people in the United States and its territories when the Agency was created more than 50 years ago. </p></article>

<p>In March 2022, reached a settlement with Chevron Phillips Chemical Company to install and operate air pollution controls at three petrochemical manufacturing facilities in Texas located in areas of environmental justice concern; monitoring results will be publicly posted, and corrective actions are required if emissions exceed certain thresholds. Took aggressive, early enforcement actions in communities with environmental justice concerns: In August 2022, following negotiations that considered concerns voiced by the local community, secured a preliminary injunction for the Toa Alta Municipal Solid Waste Landfill to take immediate action to address urgent human health and environmental concerns. Issued two Clean Air Act emergency orders to shut down the Limetree Refinery in the U.S. Virgin Islands (June 2021) where residents were sickened by excess sulfur and hydrogen sulfide emissions and to cut hydrogen sulfide emissions from the New Indy plant in South Carolina (May 2021). Provided more enforcement information to communities about facilities, pollution, and enforcement activities through press releases, desk statements, public meetings, and websites focused on specific communities and incidents (e.g., Refinery on St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, H2S in South and North Carolina, Toa Alta Landfill in Puerto Rico). Increased efforts to obtain input from communities on potential remedies prior to finalizing settlement agreements. Developed analytical approaches to address environmental justice implications of major regulatory proposals and final rules. For example, For the Oil and Natural Gas New Source Performance Standard proposal (November 2021) and the Supplemental Proposal (November 2022), EPA held virtual trainings (900 + participants) marketed to communities with environmental justice concerns and Tribes to assist their ability to understand and comment meaningfully on the proposal. EPA's proposal included requirements for states to undertake meaningful outreach and engagement with communities with environmental justice concerns as they develop their plans for regulating existing oil and gas sources under the emissions guidelines. In the final nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission standards for trucks, conducted analyses of the <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">number</span> and demographics of the populations living within close proximity to truck freight routes. This final rule will likely result in widespread air quality improvements across the U.S., especially in areas already overburdened by air pollution and diesel emissions, beginning with model year 2027. In July 2023, issued proposed rules to strengthen lead paint standards to protect against childhood lead exposure. Developed a Strategy to Reduce Lead Exposures and Disparities in US Communities to advance EPA's work to protect the public from lead with an emphasis on high - risk communities. Announced the allotment of $ 2.865B FY 2023 funds from the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund for identification and replacement of lead service lines (LSLs). As part of the Lead Service Line Replacement (LSLR) Accelerators, EPA and 4 state partners are working with 40 communities to address existing barriers and accelerate progress towards LSL identification and replacement. The new Accelerator provides targeted technical assistance services to help communities with environmental justice concerns access funds from President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law4 and this initiative will prioritize benefits to communities with EJ concerns and promote equity. Provided Spanish Lead Awareness Curriculum for Indian Country. </p></article>

<p>subgrants to communities in their regional coverage areas in amounts between $ 100 - 350K. These subgrants will essentially replace EPA's traditional grant programs such as the EJ Small Grants, which would provide such small levels of support directly to communities through a traditional government grant competition and award process. The subawards through the Grantmakers will achieve two equity goals - greatly reducing the burden capacity - constrained communities face when seeking small amounts of funding directly from the federal government, and also increasing the speed with which communities receive an award. EPA plans to make at least eleven (11) Grantmaker awards across the United States with $ 50M each, of which at least $ 40M must be directly subawarded to capacity - constrained communities. EPA anticipates that over the next three years the Grantmakers will make approximately 2,000 subawards in the amounts cited. EPA has announced the eleven (11) recipients of the EJ TCGM awards totaling $ 600M. Launched a new $ 2B Environment and Climate Justice Community <span style="background-color: rgba(204, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="progress">Change</span> Grant program with a focus on re - envisioning the application process to ensure equity.

EPA will continue to strengthen EPA's external Civil Rights program and EPA's ability to enforce federal civil rights laws to their fullest extent, including by fully implementing EPA's authority to conduct investigations, compliance reviews, and other compliance and enforcement activities, issue policy guidance, and secure timely and effective resolutions to address discrimination. Priority Strategy # 4: Protect Children Equitably from Exposure to Environmental Contaminants. EPA will protect children's environmental health, especially in communities with environmental justice concerns, by consistently and explicitly considering early life exposures to environmental contaminants and lifelong health in decisions involving human health science, risk assessment, regulations, compliance and enforcement, partnerships, communications, and research. Priority Strategy # 5: Address Inequitable Access to Information and Resources to Improve Engagement and Health Impacts in Rural Communities. EPA will provide financial and technical assistance to small and rural communities to establish and improve services to lower the risk of harm to public health and protect the environment. This strategy focuses on removing barriers to resources and providing impactful improvements for rural communities. Priority Strategy # 6: Ensure Public Access to EPA Programs and Activities and Ensure Full Protection from Health and Environmental Harms for People with Disabilities.

<p>Gaps in capacity and coordination within the federal family to support economic revitalization, infrastructure improvements, and other community - specific needs. Rural communities can include underserved persons who experience inconsistent access to safe drinking water and sanitation services, due to either personal resources (e.g., homeowner well or septic system) or lack of ratepayers for public system maintenance or improvements. Rural economies are more dependent on natural resources, which may be disproportionately affected by pollution, chemical exposures, and from climate <span style="background-color: rgba(204, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="progress">change</span>. Rural communities may receive inequitable access to information and EPA opportunities (e.g., unreliable internet access). When equity screening information is needed or encouraged for competitive funding opportunities, a lack of robust data can inadvertently disadvantage rural communities ' ability to successfully compete for these resources (e.g., identification of communities in EJScreen and other screening tools). Requirements of funding opportunities, imposed through statute, regulation, or practice, can create additional burdens on rural communities (e.g., to perform a feasibility study). Limited access to resources (materials, skilled labor, expert consultants, etc.) in rural communities can result in more costly project expenses, delayed timelines, and / or incorrectly scoped projects. </p></article>

Federal construction projects act as anchors for economic security, reliable opportunities for good local jobs, defenses against the negative impacts of climate <span style="background-color: rgba(204, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="progress">change</span>, and can advance the overall livability and vitality of American communities. GSA's work often occurs in or adjacent to disadvantaged communities that have suffered from long - standing underinvestment and have dealt with historic challenges and barriers to equitable development. These communities tend to have poor transportation connectivity to job opportunities, higher exposure to many forms of pollution, and less access to green space. The impacts of this inequity are apparent in the persistent lower household income, high unemployment, and poorer health outcomes. 8 In order to help overcome these barriers, GSA is executing projects with enhanced stakeholder engagement and data analysis to better inform GSA decisionmakers and project teams about local development contexts and better connect project location, design, and facility operations with the needs of those communities that will benefit from more equitable development. </p></article>

<p>The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP) was designed to address immediate needs related to the COVID - 19 pandemic, with a specific focus on addressing historically disparate outcomes across race, class, and geography that were further exacerbated by the pandemic. To support the Federal Government's exploration of questions about equitable recovery, GSA's Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) established an ARP Evaluation Portfolio with two core elements: a national evaluation conducted by a third - party research contract, and a portfolio of evaluations conducted by OES, in partnership with agencies and the White House Office of Management and Budget, on ARP - funded programs with equity goals. This body of work explores effectiveness of critical relief programs like Emergency Rental Assistance and Homeowner Assistance Fund. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) provides $ 3.4 billion for GSA's Public Buildings Service, making a significant impact on 26 Land Ports of Entry modernizations along the Canadian and Mexican border. These projects will create new good - paying jobs, bolster safety and security, and make our economy more resilient to supply chain challenges - all while serving as models for sustainability and innovation and improving community livability. The Inflation <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">Reduction</span> Act (IRA) provides GSA with $ 2.15 billion for low - embodied carbon materials in construction and renovation projects, $ 975 million for GSA to support emerging and sustainable technologies, and $ 250 million to turn even more GSA facilities into High - Performance Green Buildings and accelerate efforts to achieve a net - zero Federal footprint. These investments will reduce long - term energy costs for American communities, strengthen America's domestic industrial base and catalyze innovation and job <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">growth</span> in homegrown industries that produce next - generation materials, products, and equipment. GSA estimates that these projects will create over 9,500 average annual economy - wide jobs across the length of the projects, support $ 2.8 billion in labor income, and generate nearly $ 1 billion in tax revenue for Federal, State and local governments. </p></article>

<p>Expand Federal agency use of the Forecast of Contracting Opportunities Tool. The tool assists with acquisition planning by helping vendors learn about potential prime contracting opportunities early in the process. Improved search functionality will simplify the process for the Federal user to post and maintain opportunities. Maximizing Federal agency use of the tool and creating a single forecast for the public to access will greatly ease the burden on small businesses attempting to track opportunities across multiple sources of information. Launch and scale Federal agency adoption of new Government - wide Procurement Equity Tool. The tool uses Federal contracting data sources to support market research focused on small disadvantaged businesses. Federal agencies can use the tool to find SDBs by geographic location, business type and category. Agencies can also find new SDBs that have <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">registered</span> to do business but have yet to receive a federal award. Enhance eBuy, the Request for Quote (RFQ) platform for GSA Schedule. eBuy is a powerful and intuitive acquisition tool used by thousands of Federal agencies and military services worldwide to help save government time and money as acquisitions achieve required competition, best pricing and value. Planned and ongoing updates to eBuy include new features that benefit both buyers and sellers by creating more visibility and simplification in quoting, Request for Information (RFI), and RFQ interactions. </p></article>

<p>Create new sustainability - focused markets in coordination with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Defense. Climate risk adaptation efforts and Federal sustainability goals are positioned to deploy hundreds of millions of dollars in new acquisition opportunities, including those available to small businesses, over the near / medium term. GSA is driving new and emerging market successes in Low Embodied Carbon building materials, Zero - Emission Vehicles and supply equipment, scaling of eco - labels to reduce per - and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and expediting procurement availability of environmental technologies. Finalize solicitations and awards for new Polaris and OASIS + contracts. 3 These newly launched governmentwide IT and professional services contracts offer more opportunities for small businesses to compete for prime contracts, including small business and socioeconomic set - asides. Since 2015, GSA's current OASIS vehicle has helped Federal agencies obligate more than $ 67 billion. Improve accessibility and reduce administrative burden. GSA committed to reviewing 37 Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) forms and identifying six design changes to appearance and layout (e.g., limiting use of capitalization and italics, continuity of 12 - point font and bolded text for readability) that could make the standard forms easier to navigate for people with dyslexia, limited vision and intellectual disabilities. GSA will redesign FAR forms and launch a public awareness campaign about the updates. For FY 2024, GSA will also <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">increase</span> its pledge to the AbilityOne program, a critical source for buying goods and services from suppliers who support the employment of people with disabilities.

<p>Preventing Child Welfare System Involvement: We understand that families in poverty and those in Tribal and other communities are impacted by the child welfare system more than others, in some cases largely because they lack sufficient access to economic resources and community networks. Our efforts will be directed at connecting families in need to supports that enable them to stay together and preventing discriminatory and other practices that make it difficult for children, youth, and families to heal when child welfare is involved. Promoting Accessible and Welcoming Health Care: A lack of health insurance coverage and social and geographic barriers to care mean that not everyone is receiving health care that meets their needs within their communities. Our actions will promote access to comprehensive insurance coverage and quality care designed to meet the diverse needs of Americans so everyone can benefit from preventive care and effective treatments. Improving Maternal Health Outcomes: Too many women, particularly racial and ethnic minority populations, and those in rural areas, are losing their lives or health during pregnancy or after giving birth. Our actions will address gaps in insurance coverage and the birthing care infrastructure to ensure better maternal health outcomes. Meeting Behavioral Health Needs: The impact of the COVID - 19 pandemic increased mental health and substance use challenges for all populations, but disproportionately exacerbated the already existing behavioral health disparities among underserved racial, ethnic, and sexual minority populations. The rising rates of suicide, depression, anxiety, and substance misuse among youth and adults are impacted by a decreasing workforce, limited resources, underinsurance, and lack of culturally competent care. Our actions will improve access to behavioral health care coverage and ensure that prevention and treatment are accessible and meet the needs of all populations. Advancing Clinical Innovation: To <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">increase</span> our understanding of what treatments are most effective for which populations, we need to <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">increase</span> the diversity of our research and clinical trials to inform that science.

Additionally, although data are limited, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander (NHOPI) populations also have higher rates of both maternal mortality and morbidity. 40 According to the CDC - supported Maternal Mortality Review Committees data from 2017 - 2019, more than 80 % of maternal deaths are preventable, meaning that a " " reasonable <span style="background-color: rgba(204, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="progress">change</span> to patient, community, provider, facility or system factors " " could have averted death. 41 Environmental exposures related to climate <span style="background-color: rgba(204, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="progress">change</span> have a disproportionate effect on pregnant women through influencing food and water security, civil conflicts, extreme weather events, and the spread of disease. 42 </p></article>

Group participants are encouraged to reach out to their beneficiaries to determine barriers to improving quality on metrics, such as attendance at postpartum care or infant well - child visits, transportation issues, or difficulty scheduling. These consultations help inform states of barriers encountered by beneficiaries. HHS OMH and CMS CMCS held a listening session to gather consumer feedback regarding using inclusive maternal language (especially as it relates to the word " " maternal " " and non - binary or gender conforming people). Participants included professionals with direct clinical, research, or system - level expertise on inclusive language or experience in providing affirming care for non - binary and transgender patients. One key takeaway was that Inclusive language is important to make people feel cared for by their providers. NIH sponsored the Connecting the Community for Maternal Health Challenge to encourage and reward nonprofit community - based or advocacy organizations to develop research capabilities and infrastructure to pursue maternal health research projects. The challenge offered approximately $ 3 million in prizes, distributed across multiple phases of the competition to organizations that successfully completed the objectives and requirements of each phase. Three webinars introduced the challenge sponsors at NIH, provided general guidance on proposal submission, and shared the opportunities that participation in this challenge provide. Ongoing webinars are providing guidance to participants in building and sustaining their research activities. </p></article>

<p>HUD works with Continuums of Care (CoC) nationally that prepare community plans to organize and deliver housing and services to meet the specific needs of people who are homeless as they move to stable housing and maximum self - sufficiency. As part of our equity focus, SNAPS conducted its second Coordinated Entry Equity Demonstration, deploying teams of technical assistance coaches to 15 Continuums of Care covering a broad range of communities. The goal of the demonstration was to design a more equitable assessment and prioritization process to improve conditions and outcomes for all Black and Brown people. The technical assistance coaching teams included providers with experience in racial equity and housing justice work, coordinated entry design, lived experience of homelessness, and navigating homeless systems and other related disciplines. In partnership with Black and Brown people as well as people with lived expertise of homelessness, CoCs identified system disparities through analyzing local data, agreed upon focus areas, and tested racially equitable coordinated entry system processes in service of significantly transforming the experience and housing stability of those disproportionately represented in local homeless responsive systems.

<p>FHA has taken additional steps through the Office of Single Family Housing (SFH) to support wealth generation activities for prospective and current homeowners. Specifically, SFH expanded access to credit by incorporating a borrower's positive rental payment history into the mortgage underwriting process. Using rental payment history promotes a more inclusive credit evaluation, which in turn can expand homeownership opportunities to first - time homebuyers. This guidance is expected to continue to expand homeownership opportunities for borrowers where a positive rental payment history can make a <span style="background-color: rgba(204, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="impact">difference</span> when combined with other assessment factors for determining eligibility for FHA - insured mortgage financing.

In March 2023, HUD awarded $ 54 million to 182 fair housing organizations across the country under its Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP), an <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">increase</span> of $ 7 million from the prior year's funding cycle. The grants will provide $ 28,200,000 to support the efforts national, state, and local fair housing entities working to address violations of the Fair Housing Act and helping to end discrimination in housing. In addition, HUD provided $ 26,350,000 in funding to its second - and third - year Private Enforcement Initiative grantees to continue fair housing enforcement efforts nationwide. Eligible activities for the funding awarded include testing for appraisal bias and educating local communities on the issue. The grant funding will allow the grantees to provide fair housing enforcement by conducting investigations, testing to identify discrimination in the rental and sales markets, and filing fair housing complaints with HUD or substantially equivalent state and local agencies. Grantees will conduct education and outreach activities to inform the public, housing providers, and local governments about rights and responsibilities that exist under the Fair Housing Act. </p></article>

<p>Across the housing market, landlords increasingly rely on tenant screening reports as part of their selection criteria, but research shows that these reports often include inaccurate information, including inaccuracies in criminal and eviction records and credit history. If prospective renters are not given the opportunity to review and correct the information in these reports, then they may be repeatedly denied housing as a result of inaccurate information in their tenant screening reports. In addition, housing providers may miss opportunities to consider qualified applicants as tenants.

<p>Barriers to Equity: For most communities across the country, the demand for affordable housing far exceeds the supply and the problem has been getting worse. HUD's most recent Worst Case Housing Needs report shows that in 2021, only 57 housing units were affordable and available for every 100 very low - income households, and more than 8.5 million households had worst case housing needs, meaning they have very low incomes, lack housing assistance, and have either severe rent burdens or severely inadequate housing (or both).

To better serve individuals and families, HUD has expanded the Family Self Sufficiency program for HUD - assisted residents to initiate a path to realizing their homeownership dreams. HUD will also support current homeowners by combatting the historic impacts of racial bias in the home appraisal process that erodes equity and robs Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities of the opportunity to maintain and grow generational wealth. Reduce barriers and enhance support for protected classes by enforcing fair housing regulations, advancing housing justice, and improving rental assistance: HUD's primary focus in advancing housing justice is to expand the Department's role in proactively supporting and protecting underserved communities through increased Fair Housing Law enforcement and compliance. As detailed within this Equity Action Plan, HUD will enact a dedicated training curriculum to national fair housing partners to ensure that knowledge of Fair Housing protections is widespread and actionable in local communities. Similarly, HUD will employ targeted efforts to engage with key populations, including those impacted by gender - based violence, LGBTQIA + communities, and people impacted by the criminal justice system, to improve the administration and delivery of HUD - assisted programs and services. Reduce racial and ethnic disparities in homeless systems through identifying and addressing barriers to engagement by underserved populations: Promoting equity is a key component in reducing homelessness. People experiencing homelessness are among the most underserved and overlooked - most especially Black, Hispanic, and Native American or Alaska Native people, who experienced increases in homelessness and are significantly overrepresented among this population. Through specialized research and data gathering initiatives, the Agency will continue to improve its ability to better identify, engage, and re - house Black, Brown, Indigenous and other systematically disadvantaged people experiencing unsheltered homelessness. In addition, HUD will expand its work with program and community partners to incorporate the voice and leadership of people with lived experience to create tailored, equitable solutions for individuals ' needs to accentuate a new approach to homelessness relief and further equal access to eviction protection resources.

HUD and FHAP agencies consistently receive more than 10,000 complaints per year (11,741 in FY 2022), with disability as the most common basis for alleged discrimination, followed by race and sex. For more than 40 years, HUD's Housing Discrimination studies have documented the persistence of housing discrimination among protected classes. For example, HUD's 2017 study of Rental Housing Discrimination on the Basis of Mental Disabilities found that individuals with mental illness and intellectual or developmental disabilities experienced significant levels of adverse differential treatment in the rental market, including being less likely to receive a response to their inquiries and less likely to be told a unit was available. A 2021 study of Housing Discrimination Against Same - Sex Couples and Transgender Individuals found that housing providers treated lesbians comparably to heterosexual women seeking rental housing, told gay men about fewer available rental units than they told heterosexual men, and told transgender testers about fewer units than they told cisgender home seekers. The pervasive use of criminal background checks during tenant screening can create a barrier to renting housing, even though that information may be incomplete or inaccurate and information about past criminal history is not necessarily a reliable predictor of housing success. Studies have also found that Black and Hispanic communities, are disproportionately affected by tenant screening practices that include a criminal background check. A growing body of evidence shows that the provision of housing assistance, particularly when accompanied with supportive services, can help reduce recidivism and <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">decrease</span> involvement in the criminal justice system, thereby strengthening public safety. HUD's forthcoming study of the Housing Needs of Survivors of Human Trafficking finds that survivors of human trafficking and those at risk of trafficking, both highly vulnerable populations, face substantial hurdles in finding affordable housing related to landlord screening for criminal background, credit history, and rental history. </p></article>

<p>HUD's 2021 Annual Homeless Assessment Report finds that 10 <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">percent</span> of Black heads of households in poverty and 12 <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">percent</span> of Native American or Alaska Native households in poverty experienced sheltered homelessness at some point in 2021, compared to 3 <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">percent</span> of all households in poverty. That Black and Brown people experience homelessness at higher rates than white households is consistent with HUD's research on Worst Case Housing Needs, which finds that Black and Hispanic households are more likely to be very low - income, renters, and paying more than 50 <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">percent</span> of their income on rent than other groups. These statistics highly correlate with higher probably that someone will experience homelessness. Research suggests that Black and Brown households, particularly low - income renter households headed by Black women, experience evictions at disproportionately high rates. Evictions contribute to long - term housing instability and homelessness. Other factors contributing to disproportionate rates of homelessness among Black and Brown people, include criminal justice histories and discrimination from landlords and employers. In their report, Coordinated Entry Systems: Racial Equity Analysis, C4 Innovations found that race is a predictor of the score that individuals experiencing homelessness receive on commonly used vulnerability assessment tools meant to help homeless services providers prioritize housing resources. For example, the study finds that non - White individuals were 32 <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">percent</span> less likely than White individuals to receive a high prioritization score, meaning that non - White individuals may be less likely to be prioritized for permanent supportive housing or Housing First. An eight - city study of structural racism and homelessness conducted in 2016 found that race was a predictor of the likelihood of returning to a homeless situation after leaving a shelter or other program. They found that Black young adults were 69 <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">percent</span> more likely to exit back into homelessness than their white counterparts, and Native and Asian young </p></article>

<p>Between 2019 and 2021, the prevalence of worst case housing needs among very low - income renters increased by 3.2 percentage points for non - Hispanic Black households and by 2.3 points for Hispanic households, compared to an <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">increase</span> of 0.4 points for non - Hispanic White households. Research into the cause of the affordable housing shortage finds that the biggest impediment to building more affordable housing is the availability and cost of land; thus addressing the costs and constraints of developing land is a key step to improving equity. Restrictive land use and zoning laws are major drivers of the national housing shortage preventing development of moderately priced housing stock and driving up prices and rents. Land use and zoning restrictions also have long been used to reinforce racial, ethnic, and class - based segregation. As costs <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">increase</span> and housing options narrow, Black and Brown households experience longer commutes, less access to resources and opportunities, and greater housing instability.

<p>A large body of literature has investigated the relationship between environmental toxins, race, and poverty. Most notably, the 1987 landmark study by Robert Bullard " " Toxic Waste and Race in the United States " " that demonstrated a correlation between the placement of toxic waste facilities and low - income Black and Brown communities Since then, several studies from interdisciplinary approaches continue to asses environmental injustices as demonstrated in Environmental Justice: The Economics of Race, Place, and Pollution or seen in the legacies from redlining and pollution. Researcher Diana Hernandez demonstrates in two papers how weatherization can be a catalyst for reducing the energy burden affecting low - income individuals and ultimately improve health and social outcomes among African Americans. Through the publications Climate Justice Starts at Home: Building Resilient Housing to Reduce Disparate Impacts From Climate <span style="background-color: rgba(204, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="progress">Change</span> in Residential Settings and Energy efficiency as energy justice: addressing racial inequities through investments in people and places she finds that Black households, even when disaggregating income, are more likely to live in less - efficient homes, demonstrating the legacy of housing segregation, redlining, and lack of equitable access to financing. These additional energy costs affect utility costs. She poses not just utility assistance but weatherization and green energy improvements as mechanisms to reducing environmental and economic injustices. To complement the body of literature on this topic, the White House Council on Environmental Quality developed the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST) using nationally consistent data and an approach that combines environmental and demographic indicators to identify historically disadvantaged communities through an interactive map. The tool measures burdens in eight categories: climate <span style="background-color: rgba(204, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="progress">change</span>, energy, health, housing, legacy pollution, transportation, water and wastewater, and workforce development. Individuals seeking careers in the green construction industry often face barriers in accessing training opportunities (including apprenticeships) to become certified and / or qualified for the employment opportunities. The Center for Law and Social Policy asserts that " " women, people with disabilities, youth, and people impacted by the criminal legal system face especially egregious hiring discrimination and inequitable employment opportunities " " and that green investments can create high quality employment opportunities. </p></article>

NASA found that proposals submitted by organizations from underserved communities represented 13 <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">percent</span> in CY 2020, and 11 <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">percent</span> in CY 2021. NASA determined that these figures demonstrated the reported lack of awareness of NASA programs. In July 2023, NASA issued a second public RFI for feedback on barriers for entities that have engaged with and / or applied but are not yet recipients of NASA awards. The feedback NASA received did not identify any additional barriers preventing underserved communities from partnering with the Agency. </p></article>

RFIs issued by NASA seeking public input from businesses within underserved communities regarding the effort to advance equity in NASA programs, contracts, and grants (June 2021; April 2023; and June 2023) yielded examples of barriers that include: Inability of businesses within underserved communities to identify solicitation opportunities aligned to their capability and / or opportunities to partner with large businesses for access to subcontracting opportunities. Businesses from underserved communities consider themselves inadequately staffed to perform on NASA requirements. Businesses indicated that there is a lack of understanding with how to engage with NASA acquisition points of contacts. Businesses from underserved communities indicated that they find understanding and complying with Acquisition regulations and processes " " too complex. " " A lack of awareness of businesses in underserved communities of Agency subcontracting goals and the necessity to seek to award contracts to targeted business categories to meet annual goals. A lack of access to capital to cover the costs for outreach to Agency acquisition personnel and for proposal development by businesses within underserved communities.

<p>Lack of access to NSF staff and solicitations for NSF procurement actions hinder the creation of an equitable and inclusive contracting environment for MSIs and small businesses. The complexity of the Federal contracting framework hinders existing and new entrants from accessing the Federal acquisition process. Entities must be familiar with Federal Acquisition and all supplemental agency guidance. Existing category management practices and best - in - class solutions can negatively impact the ability of disadvantaged entities and new entrants to position themselves for access to compete and secure awards. Data used to validate the application of category management principles demonstrates that small businesses under category management have received a proportionally lower <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">share</span> of spending than others. Large contracts can <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">increase</span> the efficiency of contract spending, eliminate redundant agreements, and reduce administrative burdens; however, this action could adversely impact contracts available for small and disadvantaged entities and equity goals for Federal acquisitions. </p></article>

" " However, agency evidence - building activities and direct efforts to address potential inequities are hampered by an inadequate understanding of who participates in and benefits from NSF - funded activities. NSF has incomplete data on the demography of principal investigators (PIs), reviewers, post - doctoral fellows, teachers, and students. Response rates to current NSF administrative data collections are uneven across demographic groups and diverse types of participants (e.g., Pls, reviewers, fellows, etc.) and, in some cases, are too low to ensure robust conclusions about the participation of members of different groups. This reflects the steady decline in the response <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">rate</span> for many Federal and private - sector surveys over the past few decades (Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology, 2020). In addition, demographic data collected about students, teachers, and post - doctoral fellows has focused on those participating in NSF activities; data about applicants have not routinely been collected until recently. Incomplete and potentially unrepresentative demographic data hampers NSF's ability to evaluate the impacts of existing investments on different demographic groups and to use evidence to prioritize future investments to advance equity for individuals who are members of groups underrepresented in STEM. </p></article>

<p>Sexual and other forms of harassment are barriers to full participation and contribution to the scientific enterprise by underrepresented groups. In response to concerns brought forth by US Antarctic Program (USAP) Community members, NSF enlisted independent subject matter experts to examine sexual harassment and sexual assault in the USAP and identify corrective actions for areas of concern revealed by the assessment. - The assessment, which consisted of surveys and interviews, indicated that sexual harassment is an ongoing issue faced by the USAP community. - Report: Sexual Assault and Harassment Prevention and Response in United States Antarctic Program Individuals who experience sexual harassment experience a host of effects, which may include reduced job satisfaction and performance, lower academic achievement, reduced earning power, and harm to physical and mental well - being. The negative impacts of sexual harassment extend across all disciplines, races, and classes. - Sexual Harassment of Women: Climate, Culture, and Consequences in Academic Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine I The National Academies Press - (Please see, e.g., Chapter 4, Job and Health Outcomes of Sexual Harassment and How Women Respond to Sexual Harassment, p. 68 - 69).

Special sessions were reserved for the South Pole and Palmer Research stations, vessels, individuals who experienced sexual assault in the USAP program, and early - career individuals. Recent reports and legislation (CHIPS and Science Act) indicate harassment is pervasive in institutions of higher education and a deterrent to participation in STEM. Sexual Harassment of Women: Climate, Culture, and Consequences in Academic Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine The National Academies Press, see e.g., p. 40 - 41.

B. Environmental Justice Scorecard: (according to section 223 of EO 14008): NSF is advancing environmental justice for communities across America in alignment with the agency's ongoing efforts to implement the Justice40 Initiative. NSF's Phase One Scorecard metrics and highlights in FY 22 included three (3) Justice40 covered program (s), three (3) funding announcement (s) covered under the Justice40 Initiative, and $ 49 million in funding made available from Justice40 covered programs. Future versions of the Environmental Justice Scorecard will provide additional information and updates on the benefits of Justice40 - covered programs. C. Additional Efforts to Advance Equity In the past year, NSF has hosted several webinars and virtual meetings and created an archive of available content, which can be accessed here, to help inform on implementing the Public Access Plan. Advising on fulfilling this plan promotes equal access to knowledge, enables global reach to include disadvantaged communities, provides an open platform for sharing research, and encourages a diverse range of contributions. These actions also facilitate collaboration among researchers and institutions, regardless of their geographic location or financial capacity. </p></article>

<p>Federal employees and retirees face increasing health care premiums (as a percentage of income) and difficulty affording paying their <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">share</span> of premiums, as well as health plan copayments and coinsurance. These increases disproportionately impact lower wage Federal employees and retirees as there is no adjustment to reflect differences in family incomes. The government contribution toward FEHB enrollee premium is set in statute. These contributions are the lesser of 72 <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">percent</span> of the weighted average premium of all plans or 75 <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">percent</span> of the premium of the plan chosen by the enrollee. The government contribution formula makes no distinction between the grade or salary level of the Federal employee or the amount of the annuitant's annuity payment. In other words, a Senior Executive enrolled in Blue Cross Basic pays the same self only premium as the GS - 5 enrolled in the same plan, even though the Senior Executive may earn three times the pay of the GS - 5. Similarly, health plan cost sharing at time of service, deductibles, and the maximum out of pocket payment allowed are not adjusted based on enrollee income or grade. The FEHB Program does not currently have information on the family income of individual employees or retirees to enable targeting of the FEHB benefit to those with lower incomes, and further research is needed to understand what factors affect non - enrollment and how employees perceive affordability. </p></article>

Priorities for the coming year include requiring health plans to offer expanded fertility benefits, including artificial insemination and coverage of 3 cycles of In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) related drugs annually; encouraging closer coordination with Medicare Part D employer group waiver plans for annuitants with FEHB and Medicare; and leveraging reductions in cost sharing resulting from the Inflation <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">Reduction</span> Act. 2023 Employee Wellness Guidance and Ensuring Access to Mental Health Services: In May 2023, OPM issued Employee Wellness Guidance that is designed to foster the mental, emotional, and physical prosperity of Federal employees through workplace wellness tools and resources which can optimize both employee and organizational success. By reframing Employee Assistance Programs as wellness programs, OPM is striving to de - stigmatize the use of mental health services.

<p>The certification processes for small business contracting programs involves navigating multiple steps during separate online application processes and includes providing documentation for several qualification criteria. The process can be an initial barrier for small businesses owners, including small business owners of underserved communities ¹, to properly obtain and utilize the certification programs without significant application education and assistance. Consolidated buying practices - purchasing services or products in bulk from one or more suppliers to maximize efficiencies - reduce opportunities for small vendors, including SDBs, to compete for contracts. Contract bundling, a subset of consolidation, takes procurements previously dedicated to small businesses and transforms them into larger, more complex purchases that either expressly or practically exclude small firms. Given that the federal government has an overall 23 <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">percent</span> target goal for small business and socio - economic prime contracting and subcontracting participation, there is a challenge to find the right balance between efficiency and equity program objectives in federal procurement when considering how federal dollars are allocated. 15 An increased focus on efficiency via bundling leads to a <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">reduction</span> in the allocation of federal dollars to small firms and, ultimately, underserved communities. </p></article>

<p>Community Advantage Small Business Lending Companies (CA SBLCs): Effective April 12, 2023, SBA used its regulatory authority to create a new type of SBLC called a Community Advantage Small Business Lending Company, which provided for the conversion of Community Advantage Pilot lenders to fully licensed CA SBLCs with permanent 7 (a) lending authority. The move to CA SBLC included measures borrower application requirements and making the application mobile friendly. Borrower data became integrated automatically and a high - quality customer service support system was made available. From FY 2022 to FY 2023, Community Advantage lending to underserved borrowers increased by 11 <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">percent</span> by total loan count and 23 <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">percent</span> by total loan dollars. Small Business Lending Company (SBLC) Moratorium Rule: On June 1, 2023, SBA opened a window for new applications for SBLC licenses. The application window remained open until July 31, 2023. SBLCs are a category of lenders that are directly regulated by SBA to provide SBA 7 (a) loans nationally. The new SBLCs will help target critical market gaps in SBA lending to underserved small businesses. These institutions have historically lent to businesses that have less access to capital, including to Black, Latino, Native, and rural entrepreneurs, at higher rates. Affiliation and Lending Criteria Rule: On August 1,, 2023, SBA published simplified program rules to <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">increase</span> access and participation. </p></article>

<p>Barriers to Equity: Incomplete demographic data in our records can hamper our ability to determine whether our programs are equitably serving our applicants and beneficiaries. 34 In 1987, we started the Enumeration at Birth (EAB) process with States as an efficient way for parents to obtain an SSN for a newborn during the birth registration process. This convenient option allows parents to obtain an SSN without having to visit a local Social Security field office or Card Center. However, unlike the standard SSN application, the current EAB process does not collect voluntarily race and ethnicity data. Today, almost all new SSNs are processed through EAB. In FY 2022, EAB accounted for 99 <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">percent</span> of SSNs issued for children under the age of one. The <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">increase</span> in assigning SSNs through EAB led to an unintended 30 plus year period of incomplete voluntary collection of race and ethnicity data in our records. 35 </p></article>

For FYs 2018 through 2022, there were 20 languages that were often requested through our TIS that we were not able to provide. Nearly one in four American Indians and Alaska Natives have LEP or speak a language other than English at home. 19 For FYs 2018 through 2022, we received more requests for Navajo language than for German language assistance through the TIS. While two of our offices near the Navajo Reservation have employees who are proficient in Navajo language, we need TIS to provide service outside of this area. Through our Office of Native American Partnerships, we receive ongoing feedback from advocates in Tribal communities. Their recommendations to overcome complex applications and language barriers include: Assistance from Tribal Benefit Coordinators who understand the native language sufficiently to assist applicants. Assistance from a member from the Tribe, who understands the native language and Tribal health documentation sufficiently, in the absence of an Indian Health Service Coordinator to assist applicants. Outreach to inform Alaskan applicants that interpreter services may help them overcome barriers and improve application outcomes. This recommendation is based on research provided during the White House 10th Annual Native Language Summit in Albuquerque, NM. Through our LEP Steering Committee, we receive ongoing feedback and recommendations from advocates about ways to improve language access, analyze these recommendations, and take appropriate action, such as, reminding employees on how to use the TIS. As of July 2023, we have over 3,400 employees who were hired to work and communicate in more than one language. </p></article>

<p>In initial claim situations, underpayments stem from benefits that are due back to the date of onset2 ², the first day a claimant meets the definition of disability or statutory blindness. Once an initial claim is approved, the person receiving SSI is paid back to the date of their application or the date of onset if they meet the definition of disability or statutory blindness after they submit their application. These past - due benefits are considered underpayments and may be subject to installments. In post - entitlement situations, underpayments are generally the result of reporting delays. For example, people receiving SSI payments are required to timely report any changes in their medical or non - medical (i.e., income, resources, or living arrangements) circumstances that may impact their payments. When a person receiving SSI payments does not timely report changes that will affect their payment amount, the field office will update the record noting a discrepancy, which may cause an underpayment. If an underpayment exceeds three times the Federal Benefit <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">Rate</span>, the payment due to the recipient is subject to installments. 23 </p></article>

There are approximately 980,000 same - sex couple households in the United States. 31 We are conducting proactive outreach to help same - sex couples that were previously denied spousal survivor benefits. At the beginning of the pandemic, Black, Latino, and American Indian and Alaska Native people were disproportionately represented in COVID 19 - asssociated deaths. 32 For example, in the summer of 2021, the CDC found that American Indian and Alaska Native people died from COVID - 19 at a <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">rate</span> 2.8 times higher than same - age White people. 33 </p></article>

<p>1) In FY 2023, to restore SSI applications closer to pre - pandemic levels, we launched a new SSI " " Basic Needs " " campaign in support of our FYs 2022 - 2023 Agency Priority Goal (APG) to <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">increase</span> SSI applications nationwide by 15 <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">percent</span> and <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">increase</span> applications from underserved communities by 25 <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">percent</span>, 1,758,656 and 127,749 applications, respectively. We have seen an <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">increase</span> in the overall <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 102, 255, 0.3)" title="outcome">number of</span> SSI applications, nationally and in underserved communities. Since the campaign launched: a. Our digital marketing tactics generated 1.81 million referrals from our SSI website to the online SSI Protective Filing tool, yielding 345,000 SSI applications through September 3, 2023. The tool allows individuals and third - party helpers to establish a protective filing 10 online and request an appointment to file for benefits. b. Our marketing generated more than 1.9 billion impressions across all tactics and over 2.7 million website visits. C. Through September 29, 2023, we exceeded our APG target for SSI applications in underserved communities relative to the 2021 <span style="background-color: rgba(204, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="progress">baseline</span> by receiving nearly 135,000 applications. We were about one <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">percent</span> short of the nationwide SSI application target of increasing applications by 15 <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">percent</span> relative to the 2021 <span style="background-color: rgba(204, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="progress">baseline</span>, receiving about 1.74 million applications. d. We added a paper survey to 300,000 of the 2.1 million mailers and added an online survey for those who visited our English and Spanish vanity URL, or custom shortened link. We received 2,575 responses with as many as 81 <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">percent</span> of the respondents saying the information was either " " very helpful " " or " " helpful " ", among other key findings. 2) In FY 2023, we hosted several Outreach to Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Kids Subgroup Meetings and listening sessions with advocates to gain a better understanding of external experiences related to SSI for children, and to hear fresh ideas on how to reach parents and caregivers. 3) In FY 2023, we mailed a notice to more than 323,000 SSI recipients between the ages of 14 and 17 (transition - aged youth) and their adult representatives, to provide more information about the changes that happen with SSI payments when youth turn age 18. 11 SSI " " Basic Needs " " Campaign Marketing Tactics The campaign's digital tactics included Search Engine Marketing, social media, online display ads, YouTube video ads, and an updated SSI webpage. Non - digital tactics included TV and radio public service announcements, radio ads, direct mail to 2.1 million households in underserved communities, convenience store posters, and drugstore bag inserts. 4) On October 4, 2022, we established the Office of Native American Partnerships, and published an accompanying press release. The office's mission is to elevate and centralize efforts to administer comprehensive programs and policies related to American Indians and Alaska Natives. The office also works to enhance our relationship with Tribes and serves as the primary point of contact on Tribal affairs. 5) In February 2023, we streamlined the Continuing Disability Review Report to make it easier to complete, by: a. Shortening form SSA - 454, Continuing Disability Review, from 15 to 12 pages, Simplified the questions, Removed free format narrative responses, and Removed the requirement for specific dates for medical sources. b. Creating an internet version (iCDR / i454) of the form. </p></article>

We also formed a technical working group (TWG) consisting of people with disabilities who helped design the study, monitored the progress, and reviewed and provided comments on products. We compensated TWG participants while protecting participant eligibility in benefit programs, the first time a Federal agency has done this. Paying lived experience experts, per activity, fostered meaningful relationships with communities served by the Government, and offered unique opportunities for innovative improvements in policy and programming based on data rooted in and guided by lived experience. 2) In the Fall of 2023, we published a Regulatory Agenda ¹ 2 that prioritizes equity, including: a. SSI Simplification - Omitting Food from In - Kind Support and Maintenance Calculations b. SSI Simplification - Nationwide Expansion of the Rental Subsidy Policy for SSI Recipients C.

<p>The cornerstone of equity in foreign policy is direct action through the Department's Equity Principals who traveled the world to listen to and amplify the voices of marginalized populations. The Department produces numerous public reports that have strengthened their specific focus on equity, such as Human Rights Report, Trafficking in Persons Report, International Religious Freedom Report, and several equity - related Congressional reports. The Department also established its first Equity Agency Priority Goal (APG), outlined in the 2022 Plan, to advance equity in U.S. foreign policies, programs, and processes. As an example of how the APG drove significant organizational <span style="background-color: rgba(204, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="progress">change</span> by identifying outcomes and measuring results, the United States negotiated more than 50 United Nations outcome and / or consensus documents that expanded inclusive language of historically marginalized and underserved groups.

<p>Inaccessibility of transportation, physical infrastructure of buildings, and digital infrastructure are tangible barriers for persons with disabilities seeking to access education, healthcare, public spaces, and employment. Governments and private sector cite a lack of capacity, technical expertise, and political will to make society more accessible and inclusive of persons with disabilities with very little mechanisms to hold such governments accountable. This is especially critical in moments of crisis. Social stigma and narratives in society surrounding persons with disabilities perpetuate attitudinal barriers about persons with disabilities ' abilities and roles in society. Traditional media and social media further perpetuate harmful social stigmas. Institutional barriers from rules, restrictions, requirements, routines, traditions, or habits within society that are seamlessly integrated into education, workplace, relational, and other subcultures are often unnoticed inhibitors to equity for persons with disabilities.

<p>There is overwhelming quantitative evidence that women and girls ' empowerment and gender equality are associated with peace and stability in society. Promoting gender equality demonstrates American values of democracy, respect for human rights, and inclusivity and improves the effectiveness of U.S. foreign policy. Democracy, a governing system based on the will and consent of the governed, is founded on institutions that are accountable to all citizens, adherence to the rule of law, and respect for all individuals ' human rights, which requires that women and girls are safe and empowered. Both democracy and gender equality, longstanding U.S. values, are effective and successful in delivering long - term stability and prosperity. Despite decades of progress and long - standing multilateral instruments on advancing the rights and empowerment of women and girls, gains in gender equality are stalled or regressing around the world.

<p>When President Biden took office in January 2021, the COVID - 19 pandemic was causing immense economic hardship in communities across the country, particularly for women, rural communities, and communities of color. On March 11, 2021, the President signed the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act of 2021 (H.R. 1319) into law to help communities recover and put our economy back on the path to stable <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">growth</span>. The ARP tasked the Treasury Department with implementing major initiatives, such as the Child Tax Credit, Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program, State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF), Capital Projects Fund (CPF), and Homeowner Assistance Fund. These initiatives have delivered much needed resources to vulnerable families and historically marginalized communities, including those in rural areas, Tribal communities, communities of color, and children living in poverty. </p></article>

<p>The ARP has contributed to historic economic gains for Americans in just over two years. For example, the ARP helped drive the strongest two - year job <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">growth</span> in history. Black unemployment saw its largest one - year drop since 1984 in 2022 and is now near record lows; Hispanic unemployment saw its fastest one - year drop in 2021 and fell to a historic low in 2022. Treasury's support to renters helped prevent what many feared would be a crisis of evictions in Black, Latino, and low - income communities. For example, in 2021, eviction filing rates in Black and Latino neighborhoods were just 5.3 and 3.6 <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">percent</span> respectively, below half of historical averages. </p></article>

<p>These are meaningful milestones that demonstrate Treasury's commitment to bolstering economic opportunity across the country. Our economic recovery from the pandemic was just the beginning of this work. Treasury is now deeply engaged in efforts to foster inclusive, equitable <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">growth</span> through government investments that unleash the economic potential of historically marginalized and under - resourced people and places. For instance, Treasury is delivering on President Biden's goal of closing the digital divide. In the rural South and dense urban areas alike, Black Americans are about twice as likely as their white counterparts to lack high - speed internet access. Treasury has awarded over $ 8 billion for broadband projects to connect millions of Americans across the country to high - speed internet. As another example, as of September 2023, Treasury has approved 54 out of 56 state and territory applications for SSBCI, representing plans totaling over $ 8 billion to support the boom in small business creation. </p></article>

As detailed in the White House report on Advancing Equity Through The American Rescue Plan, OCA incorporated numerous equity features into its design of recovery programs. These innovative and equity focused features include streamlining application processes for tenants as part of the ERA program and permitting a wider array of services in disproportionally impacted communities as part of the SLFRF, among other areas. To measure impact and identify opportunities for continuous <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">improvement</span> OCA has conducted extensive research with the General Services Administration's Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) focused on the efficiency, effectiveness, and equity of its programs.

<p>Treasury has established the Equity Hub within the Office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility to lead research and policy analysis that supports the Department in its effort to drive toward a more fair and equitable economy. In recognition of the sovereignty of, and our partnership with, Tribal Nations, Treasury's Office of Tribal and Native Affairs is responsible for advising on departmental issues related to Tribal governments and Native communities, including the administration of $ 30 billion in direct Tribal set - asides to the benefit of over 2.5 million Tribal citizens. The Office also conducts consultations with Tribes and coordinates outreach. As of June 2023, the Office has hosted over 45 formal consultations and 700 Tribal engagement sessions. Treasury has made significant efforts to engage with stakeholders and the public on topics related to equity. For instance, in December 2022, the Department held the first TACRE meeting, with subsequent meetings in March, June, and September 2023. Since their first convening, the Committee established cross - cutting principles and priorities and has submitted 13 recommendations to Treasury. Recommendations are currently under review and address issues such as data transparency, taxpayer access to Direct File, direct engagement with taxpayers who could benefit from tax credits and working with CDFIs to promote diversification through the certification and re - certification processes. The Department collaborated with 12 national Hispanic and Latino organizations to host the first Treasury Department summit on investing in the economic future of the Latino community in June 2023 to elevate challenges and opportunities facing that community. The Latino Economic Summit brought together nearly 100 leaders from the private, non - profit, and government sectors to identify opportunities to unleash the potential of the Latino community and the entire economy. Treasury's Office of Civil Rights and Equal Employment Opportunity (OCRE) continues to work with the White House to encourage the appointment of Latino staff and continues working with community lenders to unlock potential that had previously been sidelined. The result will be economic <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">growth</span> within the Latino community, as well as shared prosperity for everyone.

<p>Under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, Treasury supported the economic recovery for communities and individuals impacted by COVID - 19 through the ARP. For example, the Department and the CDFI Fund have deployed historic amounts of capital to CDFIs and MDIs - institutions that have a demonstrated track record of reaching financially underserved borrowers. In addition, through the ECIP, Treasury has made close to $ 8.4 billion in investments in 170 community financial institutions, in addition to over $ 1.73 billion in grants through the CDFI ERP, and a historic $ 226 million investment in 68 Puerto Rican cooperativas, or cooperative community financial institutions. New ECIP reporting data made available in October 2023, reflecting lending in the final six months of 2022, showed that ECIP lenders originated a total of approximately $ 26 billion in loans, of which approximately 75 % went to low - and moderate - income borrowers, borrowers in rural communities and other categories of qualified lending. Approximately one third of their total originations, $ 8.6 billion, were " " deep impact " " loans, made to the hardest - to - serve borrowers, including those that are low - income, residents on Tribal lands and in US Territories and owners of very small businesses. Treasury leveraged the ERA program to create the first - ever nationwide infrastructure to prevent eviction, with more than 12.3 million household payments to families at risk of eviction as of June 30, 2023. This program has been particularly effective at reaching low - income and / or traditionally underserved renters, including Black and women - headed households. By reimagining how the IRS serves families, the IRS delivered half of the expanded Child Tax Credit (CTC) via monthly payments from July to December 2021. Treasury also collaborated with Code for America, a non - governmental non - profit, to build a streamlined, mobile - friendly portal in English and Spanish to make it easier for families to access the expanded CTC. New Census data released in 2022 showed that the expanded CTC was the leading driver behind a 46 <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">percent</span> decline in child poverty in 2021 - cutting the annual child poverty <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">rate</span> to its lowest - ever recorded level including record lows in Black, Hispanic, Native American, Asian, and white child poverty. Additionally, the permanent lifting of restrictions that prevented some Puerto Rican families from receiving the CTC led to 200,000 more Puerto Rican families receiving the credit when they <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">filed</span> taxes in 2022 compared to the year prior. As of September 2023, Treasury has approved 54 out of 56 state and territory applications for SSBCI Capital Programs totaling over $ 8.2 billion in allocations, and has announced approvals of up to $ 73 million corresponding to applications representing 39 Tribes. SSBCI </p></article>

<p>Office of Tax Analysis study on Disparities in the Benefits of Tax Expenditures by Race and Ethnicity. While the IRS doesn't have access to race data, racial disparities in audit rates mean that Black taxpayers are audited at three to five times the <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">rate</span> of non - Black taxpayers. As described in a memo from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue Daniel Werfel to Senator Ronald Wyden, this disparate impact is believed to be driven by correspondence audits among taxpayers who claim the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Filing of tax returns accounts for 63 % of the annual federal paperwork burden, including costs for preparing tax returns, as well as filing through software or third - party preparers. Americans often miss out on tax credits for which they are eligible, such as the estimated 5 million individuals who miss out on the EITC, which is roughly 80 <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">percent</span> of those eligible. </p></article>

<p>Since the launch of USAID's first Equity Action Plan in April 2022, we have continued to develop our WorkwithUSAID.gov platform, a hub that reduces barriers by providing a user - friendly entry point for pursuing USAID funding, demystifying bureaucratic processes, and empowering new partners with the knowledge and networks they need to work with USAID. The platform has increased our partnership engagement and expanded our outreach, attracting millions of pageviews and bringing in 4,600 profiles in our Partner Directory - 80 <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">percent</span> of which are new to USAID. </p></article>

<p>USAID Missions and Bureaus often lack the specific expertise and resources required to ensure programming fully incorporates gender equality and inclusive development policies and guidance. Most Missions do not have dedicated advisors for the full inclusive development portfolio, which entails having technical knowledge and expertise related to the challenges and barriers faced by numerous marginalized groups in the local context. In addition, a recent staffing survey identified gaps in the <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 102, 255, 0.3)" title="outcome">number of</span> Gender Advisors at Missions and their level of effort dedicated to this role. Many Missions do not yet meet the new Gender Advisor level of effort requirement included in the 2023 Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment Policy; they have three years to address this gap. Some Mission Gender Advisors are focused solely on gender equality issues, some on gender equality and inclusive development issues, and some gender advisors also cover other areas such as Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) or serve as technical office's AOR / CORs. When additional functions like MEL are added to the Gender Advisors role, they report too broad a workload, which may limit their ability to effectively incorporate gender equality and inclusive development in programming. </p></article>

<p>a) 2022 Equity Action Plan Update (pursuant to EO 13985) Since the launch of WorkwithUSAID.gov in November 2021, USAID has approved more than 4,700 partner profiles in the platform's Partner Directory, and of those partners, more than 1,600 have completed the pre - engagement assessment. By registering in the Partner Directory and taking the Pre - Engagement Assessment, potential partners are able to <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">increase</span> the visibility of their work, connect with others in the development community, and assess whether or not they are ready to respond to a USAID solicitation. The team has translated the top 20 resources on the platform into French, Spanish, and Arabic for use in host countries where USAID works. These resources are helping to bridge the gap for local entities that are not fluent in English as USAID continues to develop additional documentation in foreign languages. USAID's Inclusive Development e - learning module is now mandatory for all of the workforce. As of June 2023, 86 <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">percent</span> (11,200 out of approximately 13,000) of USAID's workforce have received the training on Inclusive Development. USAID held three external and three internal consultations with stakeholders, delivered two informational webinars for USAID staff, held consultations with program participants across USAID Missions and briefed all Bureaus and Independent Offices (B / IOs) on the development of the ' Know Your Protections ' (KYP) document (formerly known as the ' Beneficiaries Bill of Rights ' - BBoR). This document aims to summarize and highlight existing protections for USAID program participants, making them accessible and easily understandable. The document has been revised and is currently undergoing clearance at the agency. USAID developed the Social, Economic, and Environmental Accountability Mechanism (SEE - AM), which advances program participant protections. The mechanism provides a channel for program participants and affected communities to inform the Agency of harm experienced in relation to USAID's programs and projects overseas. USAID secured program funds for and onboarded a full - time Accountability Mechanism Official to manage SEE - AM design and implementation, and coordination of complaints processing. USAID launched the updated Acquisition and Assistance (A & A) Strategy and Implementation Plan in FY 2023, incorporating DEIA principles, such as: USAID simplified and reduced its onerous pre - award risk survey for local organizations seeking USAID funding. Agency lowered the barrier to entry by promoting more opportunities where applicants submit an initial concept paper (about five pages) before they are invited to submit a full application (typically 30 pages or more). This makes the initial step less costly for applicants. Issued a Renewal Award Guide and Template to train A & A staff to use a mechanism that leverages practices from collaborating, learning and adapting, and responds to adjustments in dynamic operating environments. The Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) sent a notice to remind prime contractors about the requirement of reporting data against their small business subcontracting plan and to improve the accuracy of data they submit. </p></article>

USAID updated its Youth Policy and released the new Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment Policy in March 2023. USAID released its new LGBTQI + Inclusive Development Policy in August 2023 and Strategic Religious Engagement Policy in September 2023. These policies reiterate the importance of and clarify approaches to inclusion and equity in USAID's programs, for USAID staff and stakeholders. USAID recently announced the launch of the Racial and Ethnic Equity Initiative, and teams are conducting assessments and collecting data from USAID Missions overseas to build a knowledge base of operational practices and best practices that have successfully advanced social inclusion and racial equity in foreign assistance programming. Exposure to these best practices and technical guidance will encourage the adoption of quality equity programs on a broader scale. USAID Missions and Bureaus are now required to report on a new key issue narrative in their annual reports capturing racial and ethnic equity. They also must annually report on the percentage of completed evaluations with at least one local expert on the evaluation team. USAID released the Agency's highest level policy document, the Policy Framework, in March 2023. The Policy Framework emphasizes a commitment to embed DEIA principles across our programs, people, processes, policies, and practices so that development gains are more locally - led and benefit people of all backgrounds and identities. b) Environmental Justice Scorecard (pursuant to section 223 of EO 14008) USAID is not required to complete the Environmental Justice Scorecard. USAID promotes environmental equity and monitors progress through the Global Action for Climate Equity. c) Additional Efforts to Advance Equity Fourteen country - level Inclusive Development Assessments (IDAs), which aim to map the context and needs of marginalized groups through an intersectional lens to improve equity in programming, have been performed across the Agency. The ID Hub's Inclusive Development Activity for Mission Support (IDAMS) has begun work on three additional IDAs and is poised to to scale up these activities in FY 2024. The Office of Civil Rights established the External Civil Rights Division covering Title VI and other relevant civil rights authorities to ensure USAID complies with Title VI requirements under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Division receives and addresses complaints of discrimination in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance The External Civil Rights Division's internal website launched in June 2023, which educates USAID staff on the Title VI legal requirements and statutes and how they apply to USAID programs and partners.

<p>Develop a Partnerships Pathway Tool to help new and prospective partners better understand which funding path may be most appropriate for their entity. Analyze quiz results to determine if new partners have a full insight on USAID's opportunities.

Measure the <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 102, 255, 0.3)" title="outcome">number of</span> new applications fully submitted. Fully automating USAID's unsolicited proposal / application process will be successful once there is a seamless system in place for prospective partners to submit proposals / applications and USAID staff to manage responses. This will provide greater transparency to our partners with quicker response times as the current process is email - based and not uniform across the Agency. Translate the entire WorkwithUSAID platform into French, Spanish, and Arabic - allowing for greater access and understanding of USAID's partnership opportunities and processes by local entities. By reducing the language barrier, USAID will be able to expand its outreach to new, local organizations.

Across USDA, over 12,000 grants, agreements, and contracts associated with Justice40 Initiative covered programs were distributed in FY 2022, promoting nearly $ 7 billion in economic development. The programs have a broad and varied reach. In FY 2022, for example, the Forest Service's Job Corps program provided more than 1,500 young adults from underserved backgrounds with over 273,000 hours of training focused on firefighting, conservation, and rural development, furthering employment opportunities. From July 2022 through June 2023, the program graduated 671 students and placed 755 graduates and former students in jobs, including conservation work, military service, and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">registered</span> apprenticeships. For each covered program, USDA has committed to an implementation plan to ensure that disadvantaged communities receive benefits of new and existing Federal investments. </p></article>

<p>June 2023, USDA announced a $ 262.5 million investment to support 33 projects, across U.S. institutions of higher education, designed to train the next generation of diverse agricultural professionals. The projects are led by 1890 land - grant institutions (historically Black land - grant universities), 1994 land - grant institutions (tribal colleges and universities), Alaska native - serving institutions and native Hawaiian - serving institutions, Hispanic - serving institutions, and institutions of higher education located in the Insular Areas. Most projects involve collaboration with other minority - serving institutions and a myriad of other partners, including other academic institutions, non - profit and private - sector organizations, and state and USDA agencies. Resourced by the ARPA, as amended by the IRA, the From Learning to Leading: Cultivating the Next Generation of Diverse Food and Agriculture Professionals (NextGen) Program is enabling minority - serving institutions to engage, recruit, retain, train, and support students to build and sustain the next generation of the food, agriculture, natural resources, and human sciences workforce, including the future USDA workforce. It is administered by NIFA, which is also partnering with The Extension Foundation to <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">increase</span> the capacity of the funded institutions. The Extension Foundation will provide free grant proposal development as well as technical assistance to all grantees to support project management. Additionally, NIFA is working with the Intercultural Development Research Association (IDRA) to determine the overall effectiveness of the NextGen program; IDRA will track program outcomes, report impact, and evaluate individual and program - wide activities. This historic investment will provide training and support to more than 20,000 future food and agricultural leaders through 33 projects executed by more than 60 institutions across 24 U.S. states and Insular Areas. </p></article>

FSA will continue to modify and improve farm loan programs to further reduce application processing times and enhance customer experience, and will prioritize its County Committees as key contributors for outreach and mentorship. B. USDA will identify statutory barriers that prevent USDA from serving a broader set or producers or that disproportionately harm certain producers. Some hurdles and harmful policies - for example, the allocation of safety net programs by crop and historical plantings " " base acres " " or inflexible limits or life - time ineligibility for farm loans - are enshrined in statute and cannot be remedied through administrative action. As these barriers are identified, USDA will continue to explore opportunities to address them legislatively. Eight such legislative proposals were included for farm loans in the President's FY 2024 Budget. C. USDA will identify weaknesses in farm safety - net program design that may be contributing to inequitable support, and remove hurdles and tailor programs to all types of producers, production and business models.

<p>VA established an Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) and Freely Associated States (FAS) workstream that conducted enterprise - wide feasibility assessments to improve care and benefits for these underserved and marginalized Veteran populations. The assessments resulted in recommendations for <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">improvement</span> to VA benefits and care in the OCONUS / FAS areas. Conducted Veterans Experience Action Center (VEAC) events in Michigan, Texas, Montana, Colorado, California, Kentucky, Hawaii, American Samoa and Guam that address and solve issues about access to VA care and benefits enrollment for Veterans, their families, caregivers and survivors. VEAC events provide peer - to peer connections, resources and immediate help for Veterans at - risk for homelessness. Additional progress includes the following: Targeted emails and flyers to African American Chambers of Commerce, VSOs, local businesses and local governments which resulted in a doubling of minority Veteran participation in VEAC's. Served 4,583 Veterans, their family members, caregivers and survivors in FY 2023, including 837 women and 582 Veterans at - risk of homelessness. Targeted email communications were sent through the # VetResources newsletter to subscribers in rural areas and women subscribers. Measured demographic information and obtained self - identified demographics through post - event exit surveys. Of the 2,145 VEAC exit survey responses in FY 2023, 873 respondents identified as either American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and / or Hispanic or Latino - an <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="changes over time">increase</span> of 41 % over FY 2022.

<p>OMB illustrates that VA contracting is increasingly dominated by established vendors rather than new entrants. As VA has reduced its total vendor base from 11,964 in FY 2020 to 10,887 in FY 2022, the <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 102, 0.3)" title="metric">share</span> of established vendors (not recent or new entrants) has increased.

In FY 2022, out of $ 6.3 billion in contract dollars awarded through some type of set - aside, VA awarded $ 5.7 billion (91 %) specifically using the SDVOSB set - aside. Since the SDVOSB set - aside is first on VA's procurement hierarchy, this result is predictable. However, the second tier on VA's procurement hierarchy (VOSB set - aside) was used to award only $ 59 million, a dramatically lower figure. Awards through the HUBZone and 8 (a) Business Development Program set asides were even lower. Alternatively, the last tier on VA's set - aside hierarchy received the second highest volume of dollars; $ 461 million were awarded through the general small business set - aside. These data illustrate two factors. First, the procurement hierarchy tends to screen out contracting opportunities for programs lower on the hierarchy.
