<p>During a June 2023 stakeholder listening session on AI and Equity at DHS, stakeholders raised concerns about transparency and disparate impact in DHS's use of AI. Stakeholders also recommended enhancing community engagement on the use and application of AI going forward to build greater trust with communities. Staff consultation with the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, policy development engagement dating back to the 2014 - 15 White House Big Data Papers, literature study, and interagency engagement with colleagues who have faced similar challenges and developed ethical codes and best practices in response, provide a basis for anticipating the challenges to ensuring compliance with applicable law and policy and in using AI to advance equity across all DHS missions. To encourage accountability and responsible use of AI in government programs and processes, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) developed an AI accountability framework ensuring AI is responsible, equitable, traceable, reliable, and governable. According to NIST, how accurately face recognition software tools identify people of varied sex, age, and racial backgrounds depends in part on the algorithm and data used. Results captured in the NIST report, Face Recognition <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">Vendor</span> Test (FRVT) Part 3: Demographic Effects (NISTIR 8280), found empirical evidence for the existence of demographic differentials across algorithms and developers, with the most accurate algorithms producing many fewer errors; NIST expects those algorithms to have smaller demographic differentials. A key goal of the Department's use of facial recognition technology is identifying and eliminating, to the extent it exists, any improper bias. The Final Report of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (2021) determined that " " unintended bias can be introduced during many stages of the machine learning (ML) process, which can lead to disparate impacts in American society, a problem that has been documented in law enforcement contexts. " " Commission recommendations include the establishment of " " a task force to assess the privacy and civil liberties implications of AI and emerging technologies " " and " " empower DHS Offices of Privacy and Civil Rights and Civil Liberties [ to ] play an integral role in the legal and approval processes for the <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">procurement</span> and use of Al - enabled systems.

<p>(4) Advance equity for persons who are limited English proficient by strengthening language access programs. In carrying out its varied homeland security mission, DHS encounters millions of members of the public every day, many of whom are limited English proficient (LEP) and may experience communication challenges or barriers in accessing DHS programs. Although DHS has language access policies in place, DHS has opportunities to strengthen language access across its programs and activities for persons who are LEP. Many individuals who are LEP are members of underserved communities, including racial and ethnic minority groups, individuals with disabilities, LGBTQI + persons, and others who face poverty or persecution. To address these barriers, DHS will apply customer experience principles and practices in advancing language access and implement the DHS Language Access Plan, updated in November 2023, and the DHS Indigenous Languages Plan to ensure that the Department's language access programs are effective. (5) Advance equity in DHS's screening activities through updates to training, policy, and procedures. Members of the public, including those from underserved communities (e.g., AMEMSA communities and individuals with disabilities) continue to report concerns regarding their experiences when undergoing screening, including allegations of racial and ethnic profiling and improper treatment of persons with disabilities. To address these barriers, DHS will develop training to enhance knowledge and cultural competency of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) frontline workforce, and expand and streamline the TSA Passenger Support Specialist program, which provides previously scheduled and on - the - spot assistance to travelers who need assistance; develop a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) directive to define the roles and responsibilities of CBP offices and personnel and provide religious accommodations for members of the public during CBP - conducted services, programs, and activities; and assess and propose updates to the Department's nondiscrimination policies for external activities. (6) Advance equity for the 574 federally recognized Tribal Nations and their citizens by ensuring appropriate Tribal consideration and representation in the Department's work. During consultations, Tribal Nations have reported equity concerns about inaccessibility and unfairness of <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">grant</span> and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">contract</span> opportunities, screening and handling of sacred items, lack of DHS staff and other resources dedicated to fulfilling DHS responsibilities to the Tribal Nations, lack of representation on some </p></article>

<p>advisory councils and committees, and uncertainty that DHS would pursue modifications to unfair practices that might require legislative fixes. To address these barriers, DHS will conduct a review of <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">contract</span> opportunities and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">grant</span> funding opportunity announcements prior to release to determine how equitable access for tribes can be furthered; examine policy and procedures to identify updates in furtherance of security and the appropriate handling of sacred, ceremonial, or cultural items and conduct training on the same; pursue adequate staffing and other resources where needed to ensure equitable service delivery; ensure Tribal representation in DHS advisory councils, committees, and other groups; and pursue modifications to service delivery, including where legislative fixes are needed. (7) Advance equity for persons seeking humanitarian protection during immigration processing by strengthening programs available to assist them. Stakeholders continue to report concerns about processing delays and access to resources. To address these barriers, USCIS will enhance processing efficiency by leveraging technology, increasing access, and seeking opportunities to reduce fees; and DHS will strengthen resources for non - detained noncitizens released on an alternative to detention program and create process efficiencies across the board. (8) Advance equity in the FEMA Individual Assistance (IA) program to increase participation of undeserved communities. In response to FEMA's 2021 Request for Information (RFI) on FEMA Programs, Regulations, and Policies and associated public meetings, members of the public suggested changes to the IA program. All relevant comments received in response to the RFI, including those received during the public meetings, have been posted to the public rulemaking docket on the Federal eRulemaking portal. To address barriers and suggested changes raised by stakeholders, FEMA will publish an Interim Final Rule (IFR) amending its regulations governing the IA program to increase equity by simplifying processes, removing barriers to entry, and increasing eligibility for certain types of assistance under the program. (9) Advance equity through Community Disaster Resilience Zones. FEMA's National Advisory Council has found that smaller, less affluent communities with fewer resources cannot access funding to appropriately prepare for a disaster, which leads to inadequate response and recovery and little opportunity for mitigation. To address this barrier, FEMA will enhance and expand Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) Program technical assistance; implement Benefit - Cost Analysis (BCA) enhancements for all relevant mitigation programs, including incorporating equity weights into BCA; and develop a Recovery and Resilience Resource Portal, which provides ideas and information on available funding opportunities for state, local, Tribal, and territorial (SLTT) partners and community decision - makers. </p></article>

<p>1. Applying for Naturalization. USCIS began a comprehensive review of policies, regulations, forms, and operations to identify barriers that may impede access to naturalization by underserved communities and is undertaking efforts to reduce or eliminate those barriers. In October 2022, USCIS updated Form N - 648 (Medical Certification for Disability Exceptions) and related Policy Manual guidance. <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">Applicants</span> for naturalization with physical or developmental disability or mental impairments may request an exception to the English and civics testing requirements for naturalization.

This update reflects an important step toward reducing administrative burdens on <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">applicants</span> and increasing accessibility to immigration benefits and services. 2. Accessing Humanitarian Protection During Immigration Processing. DHS improved access to humanitarian protection during immigration processing by addressing language and disability access gaps and enhancing access to legal information and resources. In July 2022, USCIS issued new language access guidance to ensure that LEP individuals seeking asylum who cannot be interviewed in the credible fear screening process are placed into removal proceedings where an immigration judge can apply appropriate language access safeguards as that individual seeks relief. The USCIS Language Services Branch (LSB) has prioritized reaching the most vulnerable populations, including victims of trafficking, in their languages and in a culturally appropriate manner. This work, which spanned two fiscal years and involved multiple language specialists, resulted in approximately 1,000 pages of translation.

<p>Benefit <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">applicants</span>, both overseas and domestic, sometimes have difficulty attending USCIS appointments when the distance needed to travel is long. There are barriers related to transportation, health and safety, and finances. In FY 2023, USCIS's Refugee, Asylum, and International Operations (RAIO) began increasing the use of video technology to conduct I - 589 asylum interviews domestically, and I - 590 refugee interviews internationally, SO that <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">applicants</span> living in remote locations will not have to wait SO long or travel SO far. USCIS is currently drafting a proposed rule that would codify RAIO's flexibility to conduct remote interviews with refugee <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">applicants</span> abroad. In March 2023, USCIS published an extension to the Asylum Interpreter Temporary Final Rule (TFR) that allowed USCIS to provide telephonic interpreters for asylum <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">applicants</span> who speak one of 47 listed languages through September 12, 2023. Telephonic interpreters can also be connected to video interviews SO that remote interviews can be completed. The TFR temporarily reduced barriers for asylum <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">applicants</span> to attend and complete their interviews. There is a significant backlog of pending petitions for U nonimmigrant status due, in part, to the annual statutory cap limiting approvals to 10,000 principal petitions per fiscal year. As this backlog of over 250,000 filings are solely filed via paper and postal mail, USCIS is considering ways to leverage technology to improve processing to provide Employment Authorization Documents and deferred action for U petitioners and their derivatives with pending filings. As noted in the U.S. National Plan to End Gender - Based Violence, immigrant survivors face increased barriers to economic stability. They often encounter delayed processing times when applying for special immigration remedies for GBV victims that were established through VAWA and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, such as the VAWA self - petition, the U nonimmigrant status for eligible victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and qualifying eligible crimes, and the T nonimmigrant status for eligible victims of a severe form of trafficking in persons. Delays in access to work authorization and public benefits for which an individual is potentially eligible, such as housing assistance or health care, can increase vulnerabilities to abuse and undermine recovery and healing. For refugees living in many parts of the world to access the US Refugee Admissions Program, they need to be interviewed and processed by USCIS while they are overseas, which presents many logistical and travel challenges for both the refugees and USCIS staff. When USCIS has no permanent presence in a geographic area, processing occurs when USCIS has the staff to make several international trips to complete different processing steps, thereby increasing the processing time. There are numerous steps involved in processing benefits for refugee populations, such as medical exams, refugee interviews, finalization of the decision, and assurances for placement with domestic resettlement agencies. These steps typically take place sequentially and may take a long time in between steps. Noncitizen workers are particularly vulnerable to workplace abuses including unpaid wages, discrimination, health and safety violations, and reprisals for seeking to improve working conditions. In addition, noncitizen workers are often afraid to report violations to labor enforcement agencies or participate in labor standards investigations for fear of immigration - related retaliation or threats of deportation by their employers. </p></article>

<p>In May 2022, CBP implemented an online training course titled " " Disability Access Training for Law Enforcement Professionals " " to educate uniformed officers and agents about their roles and responsibilities for ensuring nondiscrimination in CBP - conducted services, programs, and activities for members of the public with disabilities. CBP's uniformed officers and agents will be required to complete the training on a biennial basis. In January 2023, DHS announced a streamlined process for noncitizens in labor agency investigations to request deferred action consistent with Policy Statement 065 - 06, Worksite Enforcement: The Strategy to Protect the American Labor Market, the Conditions of the American Worksite, and the Dignity of the Individual. Deferred action protects noncitizen workers from threats of immigration - related retaliation from exploitative employers. These improvements advance the Biden - Harris Administration's commitment to empowering workers and improving workplace conditions by enabling all workers, including noncitizens, to assert their legal rights. 3. Bidding on a DHS <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">Contract</span>. DHS strengthened efforts to engage small businesses, including those owned by members of underserved communities such as women, minorities, and individuals with disabilities, through various outreach activities.

The Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention (TVTP) <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">Grant</span> Program provides funding for state, local, Tribal, and territorial governments, nonprofits, and institutions of higher education to establish or enhance capabilities to prevent targeted violence and terrorism. In FY 2022, CP3 reached 49 new organizations and over 900 people, resulting in 31 applications from, and 11 awards to, organizations representing underserved communities. In response to a wave of bomb threats targeting Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in 2022, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Office for Bombing Prevention (OBP) conducted 27 courses for HBCU students and faculty in prevention and building resilience, trained more than 1,200 participants, delivered over 1,500 products, and saw a 54 percent increase in the more than 24,000 training video completions. Additional courses are ongoing. In 2022, CRCL, the DHS Office of State and Local Law Enforcement (OSLLE), and the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity through HBCUs, sponsored full - day courses at five HBCUs to help equip campus leaders and other community stakeholders with the problem - solving skills to prevent, protect, and mitigate the effects of, respond to, and recover from active shooter situations. Since July 2022, DHS has led multiple engagements focused on addressing community concerns related to DVE, Department strategy, and incidents of hate targeting specific communities. In April 2023, OPE hosted a virtual Ramadan engagement with American Muslim community leaders to solicit their feedback, concerns, and insights on DHS policies and programs. In March 2023, DHS launched the Prevention Resource Finder, providing stakeholders with information on the resources needed to help prepare for and prevent targeted violence and terrorism across our country. 5. Filing Complaints and Seeking Redress in DHS Programs and Activities. DHS continues to enhance communication with the public regarding the ability to file complaints concerning DHS programs and seek redress without retaliation, how these processes work, and what individuals can expect from these processes. OPE, CRCL, and the DHS Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO) continue to hold engagement events for the public, including underserved communities, to provide more information about the various DHS complaint processes. In March 2023, CRCL launched a new online complaint portal, with prompts available in 10 languages. The portal accepts complaints in any language and also notes the availability of interpreters and translators for any language.

<p>6. Airport Screening. In furtherance of TSA's mission to protect the Nation's transportation systems and facilitate lawful travel, TSA has enhanced and standardized training for its screening officers and has improved its screening technology capabilities to reduce the possibility of bias against travelers and increase safety. TSA deployed new Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) software for screening systems at airports across the country. This update eliminates the need for Transportation Security Officers to determine a passenger's gender prior to AIT screening and is projected to reduce the instances of enhanced screening for transgender persons and members of other underserved communities. TSA has held multiple community engagements to enhance communication with the traveling public and increase awareness of security procedures. 7. Trusted Traveler Programs. DHS has taken steps to advance equity in its Trusted Traveler Programs. TSA updated the PreCheck application process by allowing individuals to select their gender marker based on self - attestation, regardless of sex assigned at birth. The application was updated to include additional gender marker options to better serve non - binary and gender non - conforming travelers. 8. Public Assistance. FEMA has advanced equity as a foundation for public assistance. In August 2022, FEMA's Office for Public Assistance released the Operational Draft of the Public Assistance Program Delivery Guide, which included considerations for FEMA recipients and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">applicants</span> to conduct response and recovery efforts in an equitable manner. The Guide includes a performance metric for the prioritization of communities rated as highly socially vulnerable, including underserved rural areas. From April 2021 through August 2022, FEMA's Office for Equal Rights worked with the Office for Public Assistance on its mission to ensure an equitable response to the COVID - 19 pandemic. FEMA established the Civil Rights Advisory Group as part of the agency's commitment to the COVID - 19 vaccination mission amid the ongoing battle against the pandemic. The advisory group's mission is to evaluate the policies, practices, strategies, and plans in place to ensure equity in vaccine access and administration. 9.

Moving forward, FEMA will work to clarify the recipient's legal responsibility and to structure a more comprehensive reporting process SO that recipients and subrecipients clearly understand their obligations to develop and report on their strategies for equitable response and recovery. The Office of Management and <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="Budget">Budget</span> (OMB) selected Recovering from a Disaster as a Life Experience Project in 2022. Discovery work was completed to inform how FEMA could create an equitable and less frustrating experience to survivors while they are enduring trauma. Based on recommendations made from the discovery work, the General Services Administration is currently partnering with FEMA to measure end - to - end burden placed on natural disaster survivors. 10. Nonprofit Security <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">Grant</span> Program (NSGP). NSGP provides funding for physical security enhancements to nonprofit organizations, including houses of worship, that are at high risk of terrorist attack. FEMA has improved equitable access to NSGP funding by improving participation from nonprofit organizations serving underserved communities and embedding equity considerations in the <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">grant</span> review process. FEMA continues to engage in robust outreach and engagement efforts throughout the NSGP lifecycle to ensure that nonprofit organizations have the information they need to apply. In FY 2022, NSGP held 82 events, including webinars, with over 18,039 unique participants to increase understanding of the application process and eligibility for subrecipients. In June 2023, FEMA published an informative video about applying to the NSGP, available both on YouTube.com and FEMA.gov. FEMA has collaborated with other federal and nonprofit partners to further amplify this engagement and messaging, including the DHS Center for Faith - Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, Department of Justice (DOJ) Community Relations Service, religious and cultural organizations, HBCUs, and Minority Serving Institutions. In FY 2023, FEMA advanced considerations of equity in awarding NSGP <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">grant</span> funding by adding up to 15 additional points to the scores of organizations that demonstrate how they serve an underserved community or population or that are located within an underserved community. Additionally, <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">applicants</span> who had never received NSGP funding had 15 points added to their project score (a scoring metric continued from FY 2022). </p></article>

<p>In March 2023, DHS published the Privacy Impact Assessment for ICE alternatives to detention programs, including an Appendix that addresses the Case Management Pilot Program (CMPP). CMPP leads to more equitable outcomes for program participants, many of whom are racial minorities, by providing services that include, but are not limited to, mental health services, trafficking screening, legal orientation programs, cultural orientation programs, connections to social services, and departure planning and reintegration services for individuals returning to their home countries. The Privacy Impact Assessment describes the application of privacy mitigation measures to the CMPP, including the limits of data sharing between CRCL and ICE regarding program participants. CMPP enrollments in Houston began in April 2023 and enrollments in New York began in May 2023. As of November 2023, there are 248 enrolled participants. Enrollments will continue throughout the year.

<p>The most persistent barrier to the establishment, expansion, and growth of minority business enterprises (<span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">MBEs</span>) continues to be access to capital. The U.S. Federal Reserve found that more than half of Black - owned businesses were turned down for private bank loans, a rate twice as high as white business owners. A Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies study found that 6 in 10 Black business owners faced challenges obtaining capital. Over a third of Latino business owners faced the same. Business owners of color were more likely to struggle to access startup funding, growth funding, and capital with affordable interest rates. In 2022, in the U.S., only 1.9 percent of venture capital dollars went to all - women teams; less than. 5 percent went to Black and Brown women; only 12 percent of venture capital decision - makers are women. Innovation fueled economic growth in America for the past century, but since the 1970s, innovation (as measured by fundamental productivity growth) appears to have slowed from an annual increase of 1.9 percent to 0.7 percent. Research shows that innovation in the U.S. could quadruple if women, minorities, and children from low - income families became inventors at the same rate as men from high - income families. According to the USPTO, that increase in inventorship would grow our economy and GDP by an estimated $ 1 trillion. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, fewer than 1 percent of <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">minority - owned businesses</span> export goods or services.

<p>EJE developed a Stakeholder Engagement Smartsheet in partnership with the Justice40 SE CoP which will track energy justice related stakeholder engagements by program office, technology, region, and attendees. Offices will also upload outcomes from engagements. V. Progress on improving access and equity in DOE's Weatherization Assistance Program. DOE created the Office of State and Community Energy Programs to administer state and community - facing programs, including the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP). The following bullets outline key accomplishments in WAP since the publication of the April 2022 EAP. On February 3, 2023, DOE published <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="Budget">allocations</span> of $ 30M for Weatherization Readiness from the FY 2023 WAP appropriation, an increase of $ 15M from FY 2022. DOE WAP and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) launched a Weatherization Workforce Development Pilot in February 2023 to enhance impact in four communities: Lowell, MA; Roanoke, VA; Chicago, IL; and Warner Robins, GA. The program connects HUD residents to weatherization jobs within Community Action Agencies and sets up residents for careers in green construction. This partnership aims to support the utilization of DOE Weatherization Assistance Program funds by adequately staffing the weatherization programs in local communities. Several of the communities have begun hosting job fairs to share information and recruit HUD residents interested in weatherization work. Sustainable Energy Resources for Consumers (SERC) funding is available to WAP <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">grantees</span>, subgrantees, and non - profit organizations to demonstrate innovative technologies and approaches that go beyond the scope of the formula WAP. These <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">grants</span> offer more flexibility than the WAP formula <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">grants</span> and unique opportunities to broaden the impact of WAP. The second round of SERC funding was announced in October 2022. DOE anticipates awarding eleven <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">grantees</span> $ 17M with 2023 SERC funds. The projects will install various renewables, including solar technologies and heat pumps. In June 2022, DOE published WPN 22 - 9, Managing Multiple Funding Streams.

<p>Current metric collection fails to holistically assess justice outcomes in DOE R & D programs. Current Justice40 metrics do not capture R & D impacts outside of the geographical location where work is being performed. Further, some types of R & D funding (non - competitive / block <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">grants</span>, DOE Laboratory solicitations, Lab field work proposals) do not have metrics in place to monitor and measure project progress. Justice40 metric reporting is hindered by limited coordination and some offices lacking trained and task - dedicated personnel to measure program impacts. The nature of R & D makes outcome - based metric reporting difficult. Outcome - based metrics are data that show the extent and impact of an organization's, program's, or initiative's activities on its customers or beneficiaries. 5 Outcome - based metrics are different from performance metrics, which track the key activities that lead to outcomes, or output or activity data, which describe the organization's actions. 6 Outcome - based metrics are useful for demonstrating accountability, transparency, and efficacy. 7 The benefits of R & D can have long time horizons and broad applications. In general, technology R & D strategy roadmaps lack sufficient consideration of equity or justice. Current roadmaps emphasize technological advancement of high - performance, high - cost technologies that likely will not be affordable to underserved communities. For example, clean energy and energy efficiency programs (e.g., rooftop solar power, weatherization) are not accessible to some underserved and underrepresented communities, especially where there is a reliance upon technology to communicate and access these programs.

<p>Although inconsistent, several offices across DOE have collected R & D impact metrics, such as the number of peer - reviewed journal articles, patents, licenses, new companies formed, and the amount of follow - on funding received from the private sector. Challenges to these current efforts include: Many of these achievements occur after a project is closed out, when awardees are no longer reporting on the project and have likely moved onto other projects. As a result, many of these outputs are not appropriately attributed to DOE funding. One study of the Web of Science - a public database of scientific articles - found that in some subject areas, as little as 28 % of the articles had any acknowledgements, and of those only 65 % acknowledged funding. 9 If funding is properly acknowledged, web - crawling techniques can be used to extract subsequent impacts. Existing project impact metrics fail to address equity or justice. There are infrequent third - party reviews of evaluation metrics. These reviews are costly, time - intensive, and limited by confidential business information restrictions. There is limited interaction and participation with citizen / community science in the development of DOE R & D strategies and metrics. There have been several approaches across the federal Government to address the foregoing challenges: In the Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA - E), there are staff who follow up with past recipients to collect research outputs / publications. In the DOE Office of Science, there is an annual automated reminder to past awardees to update their profile, including information regarding publications. Existing literature shows a lack of equity consideration in R & D metrics. To fill this gap, NREL developed the Justice Underpinning Science and Technology Research (JUST - R) metrics framework - energy justice metrics specifically targeted at early - stage research. 10 Some offices have project - specific metrics. For example, DOE's Building Technology Office requires <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">applicants</span> of some FOAs to provide estimates of energy, cost, and emissions savings using the Resilient and Efficient Codes Implementation (RECI) Impact Calculator tool - a spreadsheet - based tool for building code updates in new construction, improvements to existing buildings, and improvements in energy codes compliance. 11 Since climate change disproportionately impacts low - income and minority </p></article>

<p>In FY 2022, SC launched Reaching a New Energy Sciences Workforce (RENEW) to establish a more targeted and intentional approach to building foundations to support undergraduate and graduate student training opportunities and support institutions historically underrepresented in the SC research portfolio. RENEW leverages the agency's unique National Laboratories, user facilities, and other research infrastructures to provide training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty. In FY 2022, SC announced 41 RENEW awards totaling $ 32M to 37 institutions, including 24 MSIs. In FY 2023, SC issued seven RENEW solicitations and awarded $ 70M in funding to 65 institutions, including 40 MSIs. In FY 2023, SC launched the Funding for Accelerated, Inclusive Research Initiative to build research capacity, infrastructure, and expertise at non - R1 institutions and support mutually beneficial relationships between MSIs and Emerging Research Institutions and partner institutions. SC has announced $ 37M in funding for 52 projects to 44 institutions to perform basic research in applied mathematics, biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, geoscience, isotope research, materials science, and physics. As a result of SC's increased outreach and engagement with MSI communities and support for funding mechanisms aimed at increasing MSI participation, SC significantly increased the participation of MSIs as lead institutions in its funding opportunities in FY 2022 over FY 2021 levels.

PIER Plans describe the strategies and activities the <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">applicants</span> will incorporate into their research projects to promote opportunity, inclusion, and access to STEM research and training for individuals from all backgrounds. PIER Plans are evaluated as part of the merit review process. Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM) FECM is collaborating with National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) acquisition professionals to embed societal and community impact criteria into FOAs - whether mandated by BIL or IRA, or program directed - that expand the pool of new <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">entrants</span> (e.g., MSIs) participating in program <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">procurement</span>, acquisition, and development activities. FECM's University Training and Research (UTR) program supports novel, early - stage research at U.S. colleges and universities, with an emphasis on student training. The UTR program has a sub - program dedicated to supporting projects specifically at HBCUs and other MSIs; in FY 2023, FECM made 18 awards totaling more than $ 7M with nearly half (10 awards) going to MSIs (totaling nearly $ 3.5M). (See University Training and Research netl.doe.gov.) FECM held a workshop (April 2023) for potential future <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">grant applicants</span> to provide information about the UTR program and the associated application process. Over 90 people from educational institutions participated. In June 2023, FECM announced up to $ 17.7M in available funding (FOA 3002) for five different areas of interest, including establishing multi - institution collaborations for student exchanges from MSIs, new academic curricula related to geosciences, supporting interdisciplinary training in humanities - driven STEM fields. </p></article>

<p>Modify the way existing programs are implemented to emphasize the importance of delivering benefits to underserved communities and design new programs equitably, which will ensure that a greater portion of funds flow to those communities. Examples include: For the ORLP, NPS specified the following criteria for emphasis to be considered in the evaluation of proposals for awards in FY 2023: (1) environmental justice, (2) urban heat map areas, and (3) military outdoor recreation. The LWCF State Assistance Program provides <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">grants</span> to States to support the acquisition of land and the development of facilities for public outdoor recreation. The NPS - revised LWCF State Manual, which lays out the requirements for State participation in the program, asks States to be more intentional in selecting LWCF projects that are in alignment with Justice40 Initiative goals and direct States to use the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool in project selection. In order for States to participate in the LWCF program, they must prepare a Statewide Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan that outlines how they will implement the program. The NPS will also ask States, through their quinquennial updates, to include underserved communities as they identify recreation issues of Statewide importance and the actions States will take to address them. In implementing the BIL AML Program, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement is encouraging States and Tribes to prioritize projects that invest in communities marginalized, underserved, and overburdened by pollution, consistent with the President's Justice40 Initiative. This work will be informed by a planned investigation, per the Department's FY 2022 - 2026 Learning Agenda, into identified sites on Tribal lands that require remediation from prior coal mining activity to determine that which is hindering completing reclamation work and identify potential solutions. In implementing the BIL Orphaned Well program, the Department is requesting States and Federal partners receiving funds through the orphaned well program to prioritize plugging and remediation of wells within 0.5 miles of underserved communities as much as possible under legal authorities to maximize the environmental justice impact. </p></article>

<p>Revise Departmental and Bureau policies to make environmental justice considerations an essential part of the decision - making process, which will help shape program development and implementation to have a greater focus on environmental justice. Examples include: Update the Department's environmental justice policy as stated in the Departmental Manual to reflect EO 14008, entitled " " Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad " " and EO 14096, entitled " " Revitalizing Our Nations Commitment to Environmental Justice for All. " " Create guidance documents for the use of science and data in environmental decision - making to incorporate data related to environmental justice and Indigenous Knowledge, along with an environmental justice science and data integrated decision model. This work, which helps address the Department's priority learning question: " " How well does DOI collect and document traditional knowledge that informs decisions? " ", which is based on feedback received at numerous listening sessions and through public comments that will result in more equitable outcomes by ensuring that the voices of Indigenous communities and communities with environmental justice concerns are part of the decision - making process. The BLM issued an " " Instruction Memorandum about Environmental Justice Implementation " " and " " Addressing Environmental Justice in NEPA FAQs " " in September 2022. These documents update and formalize best practices while recommending methods for scoping, outreach, and analysis in environmental reviews. These policies will help guide BLM staff in implementing environmental justice and Justice40 Initiative and will serve as examples for other Bureaus to develop policies. Expand outreach and assistance efforts to better meet the needs of underserved communities. Priority learning question 4.4 in the Department's FY 2022 - 2026 Learning Agenda asked, " " How can the Department increase stakeholder engagement to improve environmental justice outcomes for infrastructure investments? " " Examples include: Develop a stakeholder relationship management platform to reduce stakeholder fatigue and help staff across the Department learn about the needs communities identify during engagements and consultations. This will lead to more equitable outcomes by increasing the effectiveness and usefulness of engagements. Provide technical assistance for <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">grant</span> writing and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">grant</span> writers, which we have learned from listening sessions and public comment is an important tool for reducing the barriers to participating in funding opportunities. Work with on - the - ground partners that can help guide and direct our outreach to communities who need it most. For example, the Office of Native Hawaiian Relations has been working with certain Native Hawaiian Organizations (NHOs) that have facilitated outreach to other NHOs and portions of the community that have not historically applied for or received funding from the Department due to capacity issues or other barriers to participation. This outreach helps inform program design to reach those communities. Use funding provided in the Inflation Reduction Act for outreach regarding permitting environmental reviews and authorizations to perform stakeholder and community engagement, with emphasis on enabling underserved communities to be part of the decision - making process.

<p>The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA). 19 BSCA provides DOJ with essential tools to help reduce gun violence. Notably, BSCA established new criminal offenses that address straw purchasing and firearms trafficking, changes to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and provided additional <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">grant</span> funding to reduce gun violence. BSCA also changed the background check process and narrowed what was known as the " " boyfriend loophole " " by expanding the misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence (MCDV) prohibitor to persons convicted, on or after June 25, 2022, of a qualifying offense that was committed against a person with whom they are or recently were in a dating relationship.

<p>VAWA Reauthorization Act of 2022. 17 DOJ is implementing the Alaska Pilot Program (Pilot Program) to advance the public safety needs of Alaska Native Villages through the expansion of Tribal criminal jurisdiction over non - Indians who commit certain covered crimes in Villages designated by the Attorney General to participate in the Pilot Program. In furtherance of this work, the Office of Tribal Justice (OTJ) has led formal consultations with Tribal leaders and continues to collaborate with Tribal representatives and organizations to develop the Pilot Program. In addition, the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) issued a special solicitation for Alaska Tribes interested in preparing for the Pilot Program through funding under the Special Tribal Criminal Jurisdiction: Targeted Support for Alaska Native Tribes Special Initiative. The USAO for the District of Alaska also convened approximately 800 Tribes and Tribal agencies, LEAs, and victims ' services organizations to establish the Alaska Tribal Public Safety Advisory Committee, as required by the Reauthorization.

<p>Research shows that through funding and technical assistance, population - specific organizations can play a significant role in effectively implementing system strategies. In fact, supporting these organizations improves outcomes by leveraging their established role as trusted community resources and relying on their proven knowledge of communities, including historically marginalized and underserved communities. For example, the White House Alternatives, Rehabilitation, and Reentry Strategic Plan stressed the need to invest in culturally responsive strategies to break the cycle of criminal justice system involvement for those disproportionately exposed to or victimized by crime. In addition, the 2023 U.S. National Plan to End Gender - Based Violence (the Plan), reaffirmed the need to support historically marginalized and underserved communities, immigrant survivors, and victims in rural communities, among others. Specifically, the Plan identified strategies to support these communities, including by simplifying the <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">grantmaking</span> process and utilizing partnerships with community - trusted organizations to serve as funding intermediaries for selected Federal <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">grants</span>. 22 </p></article>

<p>1. Improve college access, affordability, and degree completion for underserved students to increase economic mobility. The Department aims to address barriers to college access, affordability, and completion by supporting colleges to enroll more students from underserved groups, including students of color, students from low - income backgrounds, students who are English learners, and others to raise graduation rates and close graduation rate gaps for these student populations, and offer affordable credentials of value that lead to careers offering economic mobility. 2. Implement Maintenance of Equity requirements to ensure historically underserved students have equitable resources for learning recovery. The Department aims to ensure that school districts serving historically underserved student groups, including students of color, students from low - income backgrounds, students who are English learners, students experiencing homelessness, and others have the resources they need to support learning recovery. This includes the <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="Budget">allocation</span> of $ 122 billion in ARP funds for Title I schools, and the ARP's Maintenance of Equity requirements to protect high poverty schools from reductions in State and local education funding. 3. Address inequities faced by justice - impacted individuals by expanding access to postsecondary learning opportunities that improve outcomes for communities and reduce recidivism rates. The Department aims to ensure that our society is more just and equitable through supporting better opportunities for education during periods of incarceration and post - release. Current initiatives are set to improve the well - being of people who are incarcerated and increase successful reentry outcomes, smoothing pathways to further education, increasing workforce readiness and engagement, and reducing recidivism and preventing crime. This includes the partnerships that exist between institutions of higher education, correctional agencies, accrediting agencies, and community - based organizations. 4. Advance equity in and through career and technical education. The Department aims to invest in career and technical education to create new and inclusive pathways to well - paying jobs and upward mobility. This includes leveraging data to promote strategies that reduce segregation by gender, race, and ethnicity in high school career and technical education (CTE) programs. 5. Increase mental health resources with an emphasis on underserved communities, from the historic legislation and funding provided by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. </p></article>

<p>Funding: Postsecondary institutions serving larger proportions of students of color and low - income students receive less funding per student on average than other institutions, such that four - year institutions serving larger proportions of Black students and Pell <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">Grant</span> recipients only spend half as much on instructional expenditures per student compared to other institutions. 8 These funding inequalities are due in part to state policies that provide more funding to more selective, research - intensive public institutions than the less - selective public four - year universities and community colleges that students of color and low - income students are more likely to attend. This is also due to the concentration of these student populations in states with lower higher education expenditures overall, particularly in the South. 9 Completion: While completion rates have increased modestly overall in recent years, about one - third of students starting in four - year institutions do not complete their degrees within six years, and about two - thirds of students starting at two - year institutions do not complete their credentials within three years. Double - digit gaps in completion rates remain between students of color and white students (e.g., a 22 - percentage point gap between Black and white students) and low - income and high - income students (e.g., a 22 - percentage point gap between Pell <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">Grant</span> recipients and non - recipients) in four - year institutions. Furthermore, completion rates have declined for Black and Hispanic students in the two - year sector, widening gaps with white students. 10 There are a number of obstacles to completion for students of color and low - income students, including insufficient, inaccessible, or uncoordinated academic and financial support services at the under - resourced institutions they are more likely to attend. 11 Value: While postsecondary education is critical to achieving economic mobility in this country, people of color, people from low - income circumstances, and women, especially women of color, often earn less than their peers with the same college credential.

Completion: The Department will continue to lead the Raise the Bar: Attaining College Excellence & Equity initiative, focused on supporting data - driven improvement in inclusive institutions to improve outcomes for students, including students of color and low - income students. The initiative will include a series of summits, playbooks, and webinars on evidence - based practices that equitably improve completion including data, advising, transfer, and career - relevant learning. The initiative will also include developing new Scorecard dashboards using the Department's data to recognize inclusive institutions providing equitable value to students and provide postsecondary leaders with information to further increase their impact. The initiative complements the new Postsecondary Student Success <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">Grants</span> program to implement evidence - based interventions to increase completion rates, which will be awarded later this year. Value: The Department will continue to protect students from postsecondary institutions or programs that offer little to no financial value by publishing a low financial value watch list of programs and institutions not serving students well, and beginning to implement a new, stronger gainful - employment rule to help ensure that program graduates make more than high school graduates and earn enough to repay their loans. These protections are expected to help address the financial barriers that students of color and low - income students face in the workforce after attending institutions that either did not offer quality programs or did not support them through to degree completion yet left them with debt to repay. </p></article>

<p>1. Prioritized college access and college completion as accessibility, affordability, equitable funding, and verification remain barriers to postsecondary education. Improved Accessibility: In the wake of the Supreme Court ruling last summer limiting the ability of colleges to consider an <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">applicant's</span> race in and of itself as a factor in deciding whether to admit an <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">applicant</span>, the Department provided colleges and universities with resources on what admissions practices and programs remain lawful to ensure diversity, convened a National Summit on Educational Opportunity, and released a report on strategies for increasing diversity and educational opportunity.

Ensured equitable impact of ARP funding for K - 12 students to support student groups most disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, including but not limited to students from low - income backgrounds, students with disabilities, multilingual learners, students experiencing homelessness, and migratory students. The Department implemented Maintenance of Equity ARP Elementary and Secondary School Relief (ESSER) requirements to ensure historically underserved students have the State and local resources necessary for continued recovery. The Department provided guidance, including weekly technical assistance calls with State educational agencies (SEAs) and educational materials, including frequently asked questions (FAQs), optional reporting templates, and webinars, and other targeted supports to States to promote continued equitable investment of State and local resources in K - 12 education in high - poverty communities. The Department continues to work with States to provide technical assistance in using historic investments in Title I, now totaling $ 19 billion annually, along with other permissible funding sources to sustain key activities funded by ARP; this includes increasing academic achievement, supporting students ' mental health, expanding access to preschool, and strengthening teacher recruitment and retention. The Department continues to collect per - pupil and full time equivalent (FTE) staff data from States on the LEAs and schools they have identified as serving the highest proportion of students in poverty in FY19 - 23. 3.

The subawards through the <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">Grantmakers</span> will achieve two equity goals - greatly reducing the burden capacity - constrained communities face when seeking small amounts of funding directly from the federal government, and also increasing the speed with which communities receive an award. EPA plans to make at least eleven (11) <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">Grantmaker</span> awards across the United States with $ 50M each, of which at least $ 40M must be directly subawarded to capacity - constrained communities. EPA anticipates that over the next three years the <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">Grantmakers</span> will make approximately 2,000 subawards in the amounts cited.

Launched a new $ 2B Environment and Climate Justice Community Change <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">Grant</span> program with a focus on re - envisioning the application process to ensure equity.

Community Change <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">Grants</span> will focus on awarding between $ 10 - 20M to multi - faceted proposals from community - driven collaborations that bring together efforts to deal with legacy pollution, the impacts of climate change, development of local workforces, meaningful engagement, community education - all with a goal of implementing solutions that create positive change on the ground for communities. EPA is implementing several innovative solutions to increase equity through this program. While the EJ TCTACs will focus on providing more basic forms of support to capacity - constrained communities, they will also facilitate communities with higher levels of capacity to access more specialized forms of technical assistance provided by <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">contractors</span>. This <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">contractor</span> - provided technical assistance will offer communities the support they need for planning, project development, financing, etc. in the development of multi - faceted proposals for the Community Change <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">Grant</span> program.

The Community Change <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">Grant</span> program will have a two - stage application process.

Such efforts will be supported by " " fit - for - purpose " " analytic methods and data appropriate for the decision context involved (e.g., <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="Budget">allocation</span> of resources, permitting, enforcement, rulemaking, and standard - setting), consistent with statutory authorities. Government decision - making should address the historical drivers of the inequitable concentration of environmental burden, such as redlining and urban renewal, as well as the inequitable impacts of climate change. These driving principles are at the core of EPA's approach to addressing cumulative impacts in underserved, overburdened and historically marginalized communities with environmental justice concerns, and establishing a pathway to health, equity, sustainability, and resilience. </p></article>

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) provides $ 3.4 billion for GSA's Public Buildings Service, making a significant impact on 26 Land Ports of Entry modernizations along the Canadian and Mexican border. These projects will create new good - paying jobs, bolster safety and security, and make our economy more resilient to supply chain challenges - all while serving as models for sustainability and innovation and improving community livability. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provides GSA with $ 2.15 billion for low - embodied carbon materials in construction and renovation projects, $ 975 million for GSA to support emerging and sustainable technologies, and $ 250 million to turn even more GSA facilities into High - Performance Green Buildings and accelerate efforts to achieve a net - zero Federal footprint. These investments will reduce long - term energy costs for American communities, strengthen America's domestic industrial base and catalyze innovation and job growth in homegrown industries that produce next - generation materials, products, and equipment. GSA estimates that these projects will create over 9,500 average annual economy - wide jobs across the length of the projects, support $ 2.8 billion in labor income, and generate nearly $ 1 billion in tax revenue for Federal, State and local governments. </p></article>

<p>The mission of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) is to deliver the best customer experience and value in real estate, acquisition, and technology services to the government and the American people. As we work to meet our goals of delivery on behalf of the government, we are only meeting our mission as a federal agency if the American people can equitably benefit from our efforts. That means that as GSA leverages its over $ 85 billion buying power to provide Federal purchasers with cost - effective, high - quality products and services from commercial <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">vendors</span>, we are also advancing the diversity of the American <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">supplier</span> base and economic security for small businesses. When we provide critical technology services and modernizations, GSA has a mission to ensure that digital government is reflective of and designed to perform for all the diverse communities we serve. As GSA plans and completes large scale construction projects across our 375 million rentable square feet of Federal real estate, we do so in a manner that is informed by local communities to ensure that the sustainability, vitality and livability made possible through Federal investment is available to every American neighborhood. GSA's mission is government delivery - and that includes delivering on the American promise of equal opportunity, civil rights, and justice for all. </p></article>

<p>GSA has prioritized engaging in Tribal Consultations in a proactive and meaningful manner throughout Fiscal Year 23. In addition to robust Tribal engagement as part of BIL project planning, GSA hosted the agency's first formal in - person Tribal Consultation event at the Reservation Economic Summit (RES) in April 2023. Over 100 participants joined Administrator Carnahan and GSA leaders for discussions on major topics of interest to Indian Country, including GSA's support of tribes, small business <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">contracting</span>, partnering with GSA to procure electric vehicles, and a pilot program to support Federal buying of carbon pollution - free electricity from Tribal organizations. Also, GSA issued a Guide to Using GSA Solutions and debuted a new search feature that enables buyers to search for Native American business categories in the GSA Advantage! R, GSA eBuy and GSA eLibrary e - tools to find commercial products and services. This will foster greater Native American business participation in the Federal marketplace, help customers more easily meet Buy Indian Act needs, and strengthen the ability for tribes to pursue intertribal commerce efforts. </p></article>

<p>Although technology continues to rapidly evolve, persistent inequities in technology design and delivery - like higher false rejection rates, completion failure rates, and time burdens - disproportionately negatively impact those from historically and socially marginalized communities. Additionally, digital services very often fail to prioritize human - centered design and usability beyond compliance. This means that Americans who likely have a critical need to connect with government information and services through digital platforms also are likely to have the hardest time doing SO. Examples include both lack of access to the newest hardware or good internet, which often means newer digital platforms do not perform as well (because they are not built for older devices or don't work with low bandwidth connections), or software that is not designed to work across all populations, such as lack of plain language impacting populations with limited English proficiency or poorly trained Al models causing biometric systems to perform worse for people with different ages or skin tones. GSA - through its consulting and fellowships offerings such as the Centers of Excellence and the Presidential Innovation Fellows, shared services such as Login.gov and the US Web Design System, and Federal partners in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and United States Digital Service - plays a central role in the responsible development, deployment, and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">procurement</span> of technologies used by the Federal Government to communicate or interact with the public. 4 GSA is committed to delivering high - impact digital services and products in a manner that improves customer experience, reduces burden, broadens access, and advances civic tech practices that are intrinsically equity - aware and community - informed. </p></article>

HUD will prioritize regional engagement, focusing on travel by senior leaders to areas that have demonstrated best practices and areas where LGBTQIA + youth are experiencing discrimination and additional clarification of federal laws and best practices are needed. HUD's program leadership will prioritize incorporating education and discussion of barriers experienced by LGBTQIA + people, including youth, into their already planned travel and will also identify specific sites to visit to listen to directly impacted youth experiencing housing instability and providers serving those communities.

<p>In August 2022, HUD released an economic justice agenda outlining actions the Agency will take to help low - income renters develop credit, save resources for homeownership, access housing counseling, and build wealth. Secretary Fudge has noted that this economic justice agenda is part of HUD's efforts to address systemic racism and to better include and serve those who are historically underserved by government. The agenda aims to help HUD - assisted renters take critical steps toward financial well - being and potential homeownership through saving, credit building, and banking. In July 2023, HUD released a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) for $ 126 million for the Family Self - Sufficiency (FSS) program to help HUD - assisted families increase earned income and improve their financial stability. The FSS Program advances equity in the rental assistance portfolio by utilizing HUD - assisted housing as a platform to improve the lives of residents. Black and Brown peopleare overrepresented in HUD - assisted housing, and the majority of FSS participants are Black, Latino, and Asian. FSS provides a critical link between HUD - assisted residents and community partners who enhance the quality of life of residents with childcare, transportation, basic adult education, job training, employment counseling, substance / alcohol abuse treatment, financial empowerment, asset building skills, and homeownership counseling. This funding opportunity allows for the Agency to seek new FSS programs for residents in public, voucher, and multifamily housing, by adding additional <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">grant</span> opportunities a greater number of HUD - assisted residents will have an opportunity to build assets, which may lead to homeownership.

HUD's Office of Housing Counseling has launched an initiative focused on building direct relationships with HBCUs and their surrounding communities to increase knowledge of housing counseling services and affordable housing programs. This effort is part of a larger ongoing initiative to grow partnerships with HBCUs and other Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) to train the next generation of housing counselors and to empower the next generation of homeowners. The type of activities that will take place through this initiative include: education workshops to inform students on the potential impact of student loans on future housing choices and opportunities; counseling and education, including ways to build credit, to increase homeownership rates of students, faculty, parents, and residents of the greater community; Counseling and education to students, instilling an understanding of the responsibilities of tenancy in off - campus rental housing and internships and training for students to become housing counselors. HUD continues to break barriers as part of HUD's leadership of PAVE to address housing - related barriers to wealth generation. Specifically, the interagency initiative continues to combat bias in home appraisals. FHA is now contributing its appraisal data to FHFA's Federal Shared Appraisal Database, the nation's first publicly available datasets of aggregate statistics on appraisal records. FHA is also working to ensure that any borrower who suspects they have been a potential victim of appraisal bias be informed of their options, including the right to request a Reconsideration of a Value (ROV) on the appraisal.

<p>FHA has taken additional steps through the Office of Single Family Housing (SFH) to support wealth generation activities for prospective and current homeowners. Specifically, SFH expanded access to credit by incorporating a borrower's positive rental payment history into the mortgage underwriting process. Using rental payment history promotes a more inclusive credit evaluation, which in turn can expand homeownership opportunities to first - time homebuyers. This guidance is expected to continue to expand homeownership opportunities for borrowers where a positive rental payment history can make a difference when combined with other assessment factors for determining eligibility for FHA - insured mortgage financing. HUD estimates this policy change will enable more than 5,500 borrowers in a typical year to qualify for an FHA - insured <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">loan</span>. </p></article>

<p>COVID - 19 had a negative impact on many businesses resulting in the laying off or reduced work hours for many FHA - insured borrowers. As the reduced income directly impacted a borrower's ability to make their mortgage payments, many fell behind in their payments and needed a <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">loan</span> modification or some other type of loss mitigation action. As the economic impacts of COVID - 19 affected Black and Brown people the most, per a Forbes article referencing a survey, about one third of Latino households are facing serious problems paying their mortgage or rent, and nearly 30 % of Black households and a quarter of Native American households reported the same difficulties. SFH lowered costs for borrowers by reducing its Annual Mortgage Insurance Premium (MIP) Rates and established a 40 - Year <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">Loan</span> modification to better assist struggling homeowners from losing their assets to foreclosure, particularly Black and Brown households. This action supports the Biden - Harris Administration's goals of making homeownership more accessible and affordable for the nation's working families, particularly Black and Brown households for whom FHA - insured mortgages have been a cornerstone for access to homeownership. This action will help address historic disparities in homeownership, where Black and Brown homebuyers have been underrepresented. The nation's homebuyers will see immediate savings through FHA's mortgage insurance premium reductions, particularly Black and Brown borrowers who often rely on FHA - insured mortgages to attain homeownership. </p></article>

<p>In 2022, the Biden - Harris Administration's Interagency Task Force on Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity (PAVE), led by HUD and the White House, released the PAVE Action Plan, the most wide - ranging set of actions ever announced to advance equity in the home appraisal process. HUD is making progress on these actions. In March 2023, HUD awarded $ 54 million to 182 fair housing organizations across the country under its Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP), an increase of $ 7 million from the prior year's funding cycle. The <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">grants</span> will provide $ 28,200,000 to support the efforts national, state, and local fair housing entities working to address violations of the Fair Housing Act and helping to end discrimination in housing.

<p>Through HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO), HUD has delivered key initiatives in support of equitable access to housing resources and protections. Specifically, in FY 2022, FHEO issued a memorandum titled, " " Implementation of the Office of General Counsel's Guidance on Application of Fair Housing Act Standards to the Use of Criminal Records by Providers of Housing and Real Estate - Related Transactions. " " This memorandum supports the Administration's commitment to protect tenant rights and reviewed fair housing principles related to the use of criminal records, highlighted the need for FHEO investigators, Fair Housing Initiatives Program <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">grantees</span> (FHIPs), and Fair Housing Assistance Program agencies (FHAPs) to be aware of the ways in which criminal background screening policies and practices can violate the Fair Housing Act, provided tips for conducting investigations relating to criminal background screening, and set out best practices related to the use of criminal background screening information on <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">applicants</span> or tenants. The issuance of this memo has been followed by the signing of Voluntary Compliance Agreements that serve as an example for requiring more inclusive tenant screening policies by housing providers. In October 2023, HUD published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would eliminate the agency's restrictions on the use of fair housing testers with prior felony convictions or certain other convictions by Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">grantees</span> and Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP) agencies.

<p>Across the housing market, landlords increasingly rely on tenant screening reports as part of their selection criteria, but research shows that these reports often include inaccurate information, including inaccuracies in criminal and eviction records and credit history. If prospective renters are not given the opportunity to review and correct the information in these reports, then they may be repeatedly denied housing as a result of inaccurate information in their tenant screening reports. In addition, housing providers may miss opportunities to consider qualified <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">applicants</span> as tenants. Therefore, HUD's Office of Public Housing is ensuring that Public Housing Authorities meet legal requirements around disclosing denials of admission to <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">applicants</span> and to share best practices around the use of tenant screening reports and the disclosure of the contents of those reports to tenants. </p></article>

<p>NSF's Learning Agenda includes a priority question, " " How can NSF help increase the participation of underrepresented groups in the STEM workforce? " " However, agency evidence - building activities and direct efforts to address potential inequities are hampered by an inadequate understanding of who participates in and benefits from NSF - funded activities. NSF has incomplete data on the demography of principal investigators (PIs), reviewers, post - doctoral fellows, teachers, and students. Response rates to current NSF administrative data collections are uneven across demographic groups and diverse types of participants (e.g., Pls, reviewers, fellows, etc.) and, in some cases, are too low to ensure robust conclusions about the participation of members of different groups. This reflects the steady decline in the response rate for many Federal and private - sector surveys over the past few decades (Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology, 2020). In addition, demographic data collected about students, teachers, and post - doctoral fellows has focused on those participating in NSF activities; data about <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">applicants</span> have not routinely been collected until recently. Incomplete and potentially unrepresentative demographic data hampers NSF's ability to evaluate the impacts of existing investments on different demographic groups and to use evidence to prioritize future investments to advance equity for individuals who are members of groups underrepresented in STEM. </p></article>

These discussions have yielded critical insights into how NSF can better support the inclusion of underrepresented scientists by emphasizing the importance of more general impact statements in <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">grant</span> applications, ensuring diversity within review panels, and increasing participation of researchers from Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). Under the June 2022 Executive Order 14075, Advancing Equality for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex (LGBTQI +) Individuals, the Office of the Chief Statistician of the United States provided recommendations for Federal agencies on best practices to collect self - reported sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data in federal statistical surveys. In an effort led by the CDIO, a dedicated team of individuals across the agency has developed a pilot survey to collect voluntary, non - personally identifiable SOGI data from within the NSF workforce. These efforts are taking place in concert with the National Council of Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) efforts to pilot the collection of SOGI data in their national surveys. D. Advancing Equity Through Key Legislation: NSF is committed to the principle that a diverse scientific workforce is vital to promoting advances in knowledge, innovation, and the global competitiveness of the U.S. scientific enterprise. Under the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, NSF appointed its first CDIO in December. The office of the CDIO is responsible for guiding and leading the Foundation's strategic plans to promote diversity, equity, inclusion, and access (DEIA) in all NSF - funded activities. In addition to advocating for DEIA within the Foundation's workforce and funded programs, the CDIO is partnering with other agencies and thought leaders to advance the mission of broadening participation in the U.S. science and technology enterprise. The CDIO is guided by the principle that diversity, in all forms, enriches the scientific community, drives breakthroughs, and brings forth lasting solutions to urgent problems. </p></article>

<p>research results greatly exceed costs " " and that " " any economic burden falling on individual researchers resulting from a zero - embargo publication policy would likely be offset by the greater benefits of increased visibility, consumption, and potential impact that their research would realize. " " The OSTP Economic Landscape report acknowledges that limited transparency on publication costs indicates that many cost implications are based on estimates. An article by then Acting OSTP Director and her colleagues (Nelson, A., Marcum, C., & Isler, J. (2022). Public Access to Advance Equity. Issues in Science and Technology, 39 (1), 33 - 35.) notes that " " eliminating the barriers to discovery and research outputs are critically important to realizing the commitment to equity [ and the ] commitment to providing research, innovation, cures, and improved health and well - being to the nation and the world. " " A report of the General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) November 2021 meeting in Paris explains the benefits of open science ecosystems related to the equity and sustainable development goals and formally recommends that member states " " collaborate in bilateral, regional, multilateral and global initiatives for the advancement of open science. " " The report recommends the creation of, encouraging or enabling policy environment, to which implementation of NSF's public access plan would contribute, and notes that " " a paywalled method of publication, where immediate access to scientific publications is only <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">granted</span> in exchange for payment, is not aligned with the present Recommendation. " " Input derived from NSF participation in the Subcommittee on Open Science (SOS) and deliverables from the subgroups of the SOS. In addition to recognizing the positive equity impact of public access policies, NSF recognizes potential equity challenges that could arise from public access implementation. The NSF Public Access and Open Science Working Group's Equity of Access subgroup addresses this issue by identifying potential inequities arising from public access guidelines at different implementation phases. The literature points to four specific areas of equity challenges: (1) challenges for researchers and institutions based on resources available for public access implementation; (2) challenges based on methodologies and disciplines based on variation in public access infrastructure; (3) challenges for historically marginalized groups for whom critical issues of reclamation of rights and data sovereignty exist; and (4) challenges for international collaborations due to variation in international regulations and practices in data sharing. To address these challenges, NSF has identified four priority areas to manifest the equity promises of public access policies and minimize challenges. Actions include: Consult with Pls and institutions to understand and respond to potential equity challenges. A key priority is focusing on under - represented and under - resourced institutions and the potential for increases in public access implementation costs. Understanding and measuring investment in public access compliance's financial and non - financial costs must improve. It remains unclear what the magnitude and distribution of costs </p></article>

<p>NSF created strategy teams to develop this strategy as part of the FY 2022 - 2023 APG. The teams focused on Policy, Data Analytics, External Engagement, and Internal Engagement / Capacity Building. The External Engagement strategy team conducted a series of listening sessions, while the others took on resource and data collection efforts and multiple leadership discussions. Also, input from directorate advisory committees, the National Science Board, and CEOSE contributed to the final development of the COE strategy and goals. Data gathered from listening sessions contributed to developing the APG Toolkit for Improving Representation to help NSF POs collaborate on outreach and engagement related to diversity programs.

<p>All agencies and entities that make up a Federal agency have responsibilities under the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued Management Directive 715 (MD - 715). MD - 715 requires agencies to conduct periodic agency self - assessments and the identification and elimination of barriers that prevent equal employment opportunities in the workplace. Barrier analysis is a process used to identify, evaluate, and, where appropriate, remedy any policies, procedures, and / or practices that may lead to disparities in the hiring process for individuals seeking Federal employment. Preliminary analysis of AFD demonstrates that the Federal job <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">applicant</span> pool is highly diverse; however, agencies need to conduct barrier analysis to better understand if <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">applicants</span> experience barriers at any stages of an agency's hiring process.

Develop, market, and assess effectiveness of informative materials, including priority language translations, to educate the public and other stakeholders on SSI eligibility and the application process. Complete our regulatory agenda 18 to simplify SSI, particularly our In - Kind Support and Maintenance (ISM) policies. Under current policy, ISM refers to reported or estimated assistance with food and / or shelter provided to SSI claimants from others within or outside their households. We determine claimants ' eligibility for and amount of SSI payments, partially based on the amount of ISM they receive. Simplifying ISM policies will make the SSI program easier for the public to understand and less burdensome for us to administer, and reduce the potential for improper payments. Omitting Food from ISM Calculation: Removes food from the calculation of ISM. Food assistance received from others will no longer impact claimants ' benefit eligibility and amount. (NPRM.

<p>For FYs 2018 through 2022, we received over 4.5 million requests through the Telephone Interpreter Services (TIS) for 194 languages. During that time, about 80 percent of the language requests were for Spanish, Vietnamese, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Russian. For FYs 2018 through 2022, there were 20 languages that were often requested through our TIS that we were not able to provide. Nearly one in four American Indians and Alaska Natives have LEP or speak a language other than English at home. 19 For FYs 2018 through 2022, we received more requests for Navajo language than for German language assistance through the TIS. While two of our offices near the Navajo Reservation have employees who are proficient in Navajo language, we need TIS to provide service outside of this area. Through our Office of Native American Partnerships, we receive ongoing feedback from advocates in Tribal communities. Their recommendations to overcome complex applications and language barriers include: Assistance from Tribal Benefit Coordinators who understand the native language sufficiently to assist <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">applicants</span>.

Outreach to inform Alaskan <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">applicants</span> that interpreter services may help them overcome barriers and improve application outcomes. This recommendation is based on research provided during the White House 10th Annual Native Language Summit in Albuquerque, NM. Through our LEP Steering Committee, we receive ongoing feedback and recommendations from advocates about ways to improve language access, analyze these recommendations, and take appropriate action, such as, reminding employees on how to use the TIS. As of July 2023, we have over 3,400 employees who were hired to work and communicate in more than one language. </p></article>

This convenient option allows parents to obtain an SSN without having to visit a local Social Security field office or Card Center. However, unlike the standard SSN application, the current EAB process does not collect voluntarily race and ethnicity data. Today, almost all new SSNs are processed through EAB. In FY 2022, EAB accounted for 99 percent of SSNs issued for children under the age of one. The increase in assigning SSNs through EAB led to an unintended 30 plus year period of incomplete voluntary collection of race and ethnicity data in our records. 35 </p></article>

<p>Under the Consolidated <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="Budget">Appropriations</span> Act of 2021 and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, Treasury supported the economic recovery for communities and individuals impacted by COVID - 19 through the ARP. For example, the Department and the CDFI Fund have deployed historic amounts of capital to CDFIs and MDIs - institutions that have a demonstrated track record of reaching financially underserved borrowers. In addition, through the ECIP, Treasury has made close to $ 8.4 billion in investments in 170 community financial institutions, in addition to over $ 1.73 billion in <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">grants</span> through the CDFI ERP, and a historic $ 226 million investment in 68 Puerto Rican cooperativas, or cooperative community financial institutions. New ECIP reporting data made available in October 2023, reflecting lending in the final six months of 2022, showed that ECIP lenders originated a total of approximately $ 26 billion in loans, of which approximately 75 % went to low - and moderate - income borrowers, borrowers in rural communities and other categories of qualified lending. Approximately one third of their total originations, $ 8.6 billion, were " " deep impact " " loans, made to the hardest - to - serve borrowers, including those that are low - income, residents on Tribal lands and in US Territories and owners of very small businesses. Treasury leveraged the ERA program to create the first - ever nationwide infrastructure to prevent eviction, with more than 12.3 million household payments to families at risk of eviction as of June 30, 2023. This program has been particularly effective at reaching low - income and / or traditionally underserved renters, including Black and women - headed households. By reimagining how the IRS serves families, the IRS delivered half of the expanded Child Tax Credit (CTC) via monthly payments from July to December 2021. Treasury also collaborated with Code for America, a non - governmental non - profit, to build a streamlined, mobile - friendly portal in English and Spanish to make it easier for families to access the expanded CTC. New Census data released in 2022 showed that the expanded CTC was the leading driver behind a 46 percent decline in child poverty in 2021 - cutting the annual child poverty rate to its lowest - ever recorded level including record lows in Black, Hispanic, Native American, Asian, and white child poverty. Additionally, the permanent lifting of restrictions that prevented some Puerto Rican families from receiving the CTC led to 200,000 more Puerto Rican families receiving the credit when they filed taxes in 2022 compared to the year prior. As of September 2023, Treasury has approved 54 out of 56 state and territory applications for SSBCI Capital Programs totaling over $ 8.2 billion in <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="Budget">allocations</span>, and has announced approvals of up to $ 73 million corresponding to applications representing 39 Tribes.

<p>Economic effects from the pandemic led to a 400 percent increase in the number of housing loans that were seriously delinquent, and threatened to undo increases in homeownership among women, Black, and Hispanic households over the decade prior. Treasury used data from public comment processes, stakeholder engagement sessions, beneficiary roundtables, process evaluations, and conferences to design Homeowner Assistance Fund programs. For instance, by incorporating feedback on how the states took on policy issues such as housing counseling, legal services, etc., the states can learn what programs were most effective. By studying the ways to most effectively reach homeowners, the program encouraged outreach resources to be used for more effective methods that aimed to increase uptake by underserved homeowners. Research on past economic downturns found that state and local government <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="Budget">budget</span> cuts were a drag on the overall economy during the Great Recession and that </p></article>

Scale up implementation of Inclusive Development Assessments (IDAs). An IDA is an assessment tool that guides in - country interviews and research to help identify in a particular country those populations that are marginalized and excluded from access to public services such as health, education, transportation, and or economic opportunities. Through the IDA we are able to analyze the country's social, economic, political, and cultural factors that lead to marginalization, determine access to assets, resources, opportunities, and services. IDA concludes with a summary of the context and provides specific recommendations for USAID to increase inclusion of marginalized groups in their development programmes and policies.

<p>a) 2022 Equity Action Plan Update (pursuant to EO 13985) Since the launch of WorkwithUSAID.gov in November 2021, USAID has approved more than 4,700 partner profiles in the platform's Partner Directory, and of those partners, more than 1,600 have completed the pre - engagement assessment. By registering in the Partner Directory and taking the Pre - Engagement Assessment, potential partners are able to increase the visibility of their work, connect with others in the development community, and assess whether or not they are ready to respond to a USAID solicitation. The team has translated the top 20 resources on the platform into French, Spanish, and Arabic for use in host countries where USAID works. These resources are helping to bridge the gap for local entities that are not fluent in English as USAID continues to develop additional documentation in foreign languages. USAID's Inclusive Development e - learning module is now mandatory for all of the workforce. As of June 2023, 86 percent (11,200 out of approximately 13,000) of USAID's workforce have received the training on Inclusive Development. USAID held three external and three internal consultations with stakeholders, delivered two informational webinars for USAID staff, held consultations with program participants across USAID Missions and briefed all Bureaus and Independent Offices (B / IOs) on the development of the ' Know Your Protections ' (KYP) document (formerly known as the ' Beneficiaries Bill of Rights ' - BBoR). This document aims to summarize and highlight existing protections for USAID program participants, making them accessible and easily understandable. The document has been revised and is currently undergoing clearance at the agency. USAID developed the Social, Economic, and Environmental Accountability Mechanism (SEE - AM), which advances program participant protections. The mechanism provides a channel for program participants and affected communities to inform the Agency of harm experienced in relation to USAID's programs and projects overseas. USAID secured program funds for and onboarded a full - time Accountability Mechanism Official to manage SEE - AM design and implementation, and coordination of complaints processing. USAID launched the updated Acquisition and Assistance (A & A) Strategy and Implementation Plan in FY 2023, incorporating DEIA principles, such as: USAID simplified and reduced its onerous pre - award risk survey for local organizations seeking USAID funding. Agency lowered the barrier to entry by promoting more opportunities where <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">applicants</span> submit an initial concept paper (about five pages) before they are invited to submit a full application (typically 30 pages or more).

<p>The Agency identified and created a cadre of training, tools, and resources to streamline proposal and evaluation processes. M Bureau provides staff a platform to share innovative practices and systems to streamline <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">procurement</span> processes through the A & A Innovation Community of Practice. USAID updated its Youth Policy and released the new Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment Policy in March 2023. USAID released its new LGBTQI + Inclusive Development Policy in August 2023 and Strategic Religious Engagement Policy in September 2023. These policies reiterate the importance of and clarify approaches to inclusion and equity in USAID's programs, for USAID staff and stakeholders. USAID recently announced the launch of the Racial and Ethnic Equity Initiative, and teams are conducting assessments and collecting data from USAID Missions overseas to build a knowledge base of operational practices and best practices that have successfully advanced social inclusion and racial equity in foreign assistance programming. Exposure to these best practices and technical guidance will encourage the adoption of quality equity programs on a broader scale. USAID Missions and Bureaus are now required to report on a new key issue narrative in their annual reports capturing racial and ethnic equity. They also must annually report on the percentage of completed evaluations with at least one local expert on the evaluation team. USAID released the Agency's highest level policy document, the Policy Framework, in March 2023. The Policy Framework emphasizes a commitment to embed DEIA principles across our programs, people, processes, policies, and practices so that development gains are more locally - led and benefit people of all backgrounds and identities. b) Environmental Justice Scorecard (pursuant to section 223 of EO 14008) USAID is not required to complete the Environmental Justice Scorecard. USAID promotes environmental equity and monitors progress through the Global Action for Climate Equity. c) Additional Efforts to Advance Equity Fourteen country - level Inclusive Development Assessments (IDAs), which aim to map the context and needs of marginalized groups through an intersectional lens to improve equity in programming, have been performed across the Agency. The ID Hub's Inclusive Development Activity for Mission Support (IDAMS) has begun work on three additional IDAs and is poised to to scale up these activities in FY 2024. The Office of Civil Rights established the External Civil Rights Division covering Title VI and other relevant civil rights authorities to ensure USAID complies with Title VI requirements under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Division receives and addresses complaints of discrimination in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance The External Civil Rights Division's internal website launched in June 2023, which educates USAID staff on the Title VI legal requirements and statutes and how they apply to USAID programs and partners. In addition to the significant progress made in awarding more funds directly to local entities - which, in FY2022 reached the highest level ($ 1.6 billion) and percent (10.2 percent) in over a decade - USAID has developed a new method to track the extent to which the Agency's programming is locally led.

<p>multiple approaches are necessary to tackle a wider range of burdens that constrain the ability of many partners to work with USAID. Some of USAID's acquisition and assistance processes are cost - prohibitive and onerous, especially for organizations with limited operational capacity. These include small, new, and local non - profit and commercial organizations / firms. In the course of conducting focus group consultations with external stakeholders, a crucial insight emerged: numerous organizations including many servicing historically marginalized communities are grappling with constrained operating <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="Budget">budgets</span>. This financial limitation significantly hampers their ability to effectively engage with arduous and prolonged solicitations and funding opportunities.

This predicament persists even once they secure an award, as the ensuing administrative and reporting requirements can prove overwhelming for some contending with limited operational capacity. </p></article>

<p>D. USDA will create new, more, and better market opportunities for producers, which creates a fairer playing field for small - and mid - size farmers. USDA is investing in developing new market opportunities and fairer markets SO that producers have more power in the marketplace and greater opportunities to generate income and make a living in agriculture. Ongoing efforts involve investments in new market opportunities, amelioration of supply chain bottlenecks, and improvements in fair competition. E. USDA will expand reach to all producers by leveraging partnerships with trusted technical advisors. Across the Department - FSA, NRCS, RMA, NIFA, and the Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement (OPPE) - USDA will continue and expand <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">grant</span> and cooperative agreement programs that support delivery of conservation assistance, risk management education, farming and production - related education, and technical assistance to underserved farmers (including beginning, limited resource, socially disadvantaged, and veteran farmers). F. USDA will target direct assistance and technical support based on degree of need. USDA is implementing support for support for underserved producers; progressive payment factoring; and whole - farm revenue approaches particularly suited to smaller operations. Where USDA has discretion, as in the ad - hoc disaster programs, the Department has been pursuing these strategies administratively. Other permanent programs would need legislative action; USDA is providing technical assistance to Congress on these areas. G. USDA will institutionalize access for broader stakeholder viewpoints. USDA is making a concerted effort to bring new voices to the table and to expand its stakeholder base. To that end, a large group of both longstanding and new formal committees are providing valuable input, including: the USDA Equity Commission; NRCS state technical committees; FSA County Committees, including urban county committees; and other new and continuing Federal Advisory Committees (Urban Agriculture, Tribal, Minority Farmers, New and Beginning Farmers). </p></article>

<p>USDA is committed to continually improving services to communities marginalized, underserved, and overburdened by pollution, with a particular emphasis on the dozens of departmental programs covered by the Administration's Justice40 Initiative, pursuant to Executive Order 14008 - programs whose investments relate to climate change, clean energy and energy efficiency, clean transit, affordable and sustainable housing, training and workforce development, remediation and reduction of legacy pollution, and the development of critical clean water and wastewater infrastructure. Across USDA, over 12,000 <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">grants</span>, agreements, and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">contracts</span> associated with Justice40 Initiative covered programs were distributed in FY 2022, promoting nearly $ 7 billion in economic development. The programs have a broad and varied reach. In FY 2022, for example, the Forest Service's Job Corps program provided more than 1,500 young adults from underserved backgrounds with over 273,000 hours of training focused on firefighting, conservation, and rural development, furthering employment opportunities. From July 2022 through June 2023, the program graduated 671 students and placed 755 graduates and former students in jobs, including conservation work, military service, and registered apprenticeships. For each covered program, USDA has committed to an implementation plan to ensure that disadvantaged communities receive benefits of new and existing Federal investments. </p></article>

<p>June 2023, USDA announced a $ 262.5 million investment to support 33 projects, across U.S. institutions of higher education, designed to train the next generation of diverse agricultural professionals. The projects are led by 1890 land - <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">grant</span> institutions (historically Black land - <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">grant</span> universities), 1994 land - <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">grant</span> institutions (tribal colleges and universities), Alaska native - serving institutions and native Hawaiian - serving institutions, Hispanic - serving institutions, and institutions of higher education located in the Insular Areas. Most projects involve collaboration with other minority - serving institutions and a myriad of other partners, including other academic institutions, non - profit and private - sector organizations, and state and USDA agencies. Resourced by the ARPA, as amended by the IRA, the From Learning to Leading: Cultivating the Next Generation of Diverse Food and Agriculture Professionals (NextGen) Program is enabling minority - serving institutions to engage, recruit, retain, train, and support students to build and sustain the next generation of the food, agriculture, natural resources, and human sciences workforce, including the future USDA workforce. It is administered by NIFA, which is also partnering with The Extension Foundation to increase the capacity of the funded institutions. The Extension Foundation will provide free <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">grant</span> proposal development as well as technical assistance to all <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">grantees</span> to support project management. Additionally, NIFA is working with the Intercultural Development Research Association (IDRA) to determine the overall effectiveness of the NextGen program; IDRA will track program outcomes, report impact, and evaluate individual and program - wide activities. This historic investment will provide training and support to more than 20,000 future food and agricultural leaders through 33 projects executed by more than 60 institutions across 24 U.S. states and Insular Areas. </p></article>

<p>Barriers to Equity: The unique legal status of tribes, tribal jurisdiction, and tribal land holdings has significantly hindered access to USDA programs for tribes and Native Americans. For example: Tribal corporations are currently ineligible for RD programs. Many indigenous plants and animals are excluded from FNS federal nutrition programs and AMS <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">procurement</span> opportunities. And tribal commercial activity is deemed disqualifying for some RD programs, even though - because they lack a robust tax base - tribal nations often systematically participate in commercial markets to accrue revenue necessary to provide their nation, and often neighboring communities, with (public) goods and services. These kinds of barriers, sometimes the results of legislation and other times caused by poorly drafted departmental documents, have obstructed Indian Country access to USDA programs, in turn complicating economic development and tribal self - determination. </p></article>

However, the second tier on VA's <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">procurement</span> hierarchy (VOSB set - aside) was used to award only $ 59 million, a dramatically lower figure.

<p>The PACT Act is the largest health care and benefit expansion in VA history. This law helps provide generations of Veterans (Vietnam era, Gulf War era and Post 9 / 11 era) with benefits and health care for exposure to burn pits, Agent Orange and other toxic substances. To provide insights to help ensure that implementation of the law leads to equitable outcomes for all Veterans, VA has: Supplemented its PACT Act performance dashboard to include demographics such as gender, race / ethnicity and age; Translated PACT ACT fact sheets into 13 languages, with additional languages in process, improving access for Veterans, their families, caregivers and survivors with preferred languages other than English; Launched VA.gov / PACT, a comprehensive public - facing resource for Veterans and their families, caregivers and survivors; Trained employees on the new law, resulting in being able to reach more Veterans; and Used PACT Act authorities to improve national rural recruitment and hiring for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA); enhance the ability of VA to hire and retain staff, including health care providers, recent graduates and housekeeping aides; offer higher salaries, awards and bonuses to critical staff; and increase the amount of student <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Procurement">loan</span> repayment employees can receive. These new authorities resulted in nearly a 12,000 net increase of VA employees - over 7,600 of which were clinical occupations. These additional staff assisted in providing services to nearly 122,000 new enrollees and processing of over 900,000 claims. </p></article>
