<p>(1) Reduce barriers to citizenship and naturalization through continued evaluation of programs, policies, and outreach opportunities. There is a significant gap between the annual naturalization rate and the annual size of the population eligible to naturalize. Commonly cited barriers to naturalization include: a lack of understanding about the naturalization process; a real or perceived inability to meet the English language requirement that is part of the naturalization process; a lack of ability to pay application fees; and a lack of understanding about reduced fees and fee waiver options. To address these barriers, USCIS will strengthen efforts to promote naturalization through citizenship education and outreach, capacity building efforts, and more streamlined naturalization application services. (2) Promote equitable use of AI technology across the Department through the development and application of new <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">guidance</span> as well as intra - agency coordination. With increased use of AI in carrying out DHS's homeland security mission, members of underserved communities may face disproportionate or disparate impacts, such as additional scrutiny or denial of benefits based on the potential for algorithms to operate in a manner that exhibits inappropriate biases in violation of law and DHS policy. To address these barriers, DHS will implement Department - wide policy <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">guidance</span> regarding the equitable use and implementation of AI technology and leverage the ongoing work of the Artificial Intelligence Task Force (AITF) and other internal working groups to establish a framework for trustworthy and responsible AI. (3) Counter domestic violent extremism (DVE) and targeted violence through a public health - informed approach. As the Department continues to tackle DVE threats, members of certain underserved communities (e.g., AMEMSA, Jewish, LGBTQI + and Black communities) continue to have concerns about DVE threats that impact their communities. To address these barriers, DHS will build the capacity of prevention professionals, SO that they can better understand and use data - driven information on how underserved communities are often the targets and victims of domestic terrorists; </p></article>

<p>On January 11, 2023, USCIS hosted a national listening session on the Proposed Rule to Adjust Certain Immigration Fees. USCIS provided an overview of the proposed rule and reviewed how to submit formal comments. On May 16, 2023, USCIS participated in an engagement hosted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to educate USDA employees about " " Equity and Nutrition Security Among Eligible Immigrant Families. " " During the engagement USCIS educated USDA staff about the barriers and challenges facing immigrant families in accessing federal programs and highlighted the role USCIS plays through outreach and engagements to ensure stakeholders are well informed about the Final Public Charge Rule. USCIS held stakeholder engagements on January 12, March 3, April 28, and May 31, 2023, to address questions and gather feedback on the naturalization test redesign initiative. For FY 2023, USCIS scheduled and conducted in - person Adult Citizenship Education Training in areas where there are large numbers of LPRs who are eligible to naturalize and areas that are underserved. USCIS will continue to engage with the public, including members of underserved communities; relevant stakeholders; state and local government; and other federal agencies to seek input on ways to further advance equity in applying for naturalization. As part of this effort, USCIS will utilize its expanded cadre of citizenship ambassadors to share information about the naturalization process and how to access information and support. Further, CRCL, in collaboration with USCIS / NWG, will periodically disseminate messaging regarding citizenship and naturalization initiatives to CRCL's network of community stakeholders through the GovDelivery system and monthly CRCL newsletter with an audience of over 10,000 members of the public. Additionally, CRCL, in collaboration with USCIS / NWG, will host a series of Naturalization Test Redesign Information and Listening Sessions with CRCL's network of community stakeholders.

<p>During a June 2023 stakeholder listening session on AI and Equity at DHS, stakeholders raised concerns about transparency and disparate impact in DHS's use of AI. Stakeholders also recommended enhancing community engagement on the use and application of AI going forward to build greater trust with communities. Staff consultation with the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, policy development engagement dating back to the 2014 - 15 White House Big Data Papers, literature study, and interagency engagement with colleagues who have faced similar challenges and developed ethical codes and best practices in response, provide a basis for anticipating the challenges to ensuring <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">compliance</span> with applicable law and policy and in using AI to advance equity across all DHS missions. To encourage accountability and responsible use of AI in government programs and processes, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) developed an AI accountability framework ensuring AI is responsible, equitable, traceable, reliable, and governable. According to NIST, how accurately face recognition software tools identify people of varied sex, age, and racial backgrounds depends in part on the algorithm and data used. Results captured in the NIST report, Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT) Part 3: Demographic Effects (NISTIR 8280), found empirical evidence for the existence of demographic differentials across algorithms and developers, with the most accurate algorithms producing many fewer errors; NIST expects those algorithms to have smaller demographic differentials. A key goal of the Department's use of facial recognition technology is identifying and eliminating, to the extent it exists, any improper bias. The Final Report of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (2021) determined that " " unintended bias can be introduced during many stages of the machine learning (ML) process, which can lead to disparate impacts in American society, a problem that has been documented in law enforcement contexts. " " Commission recommendations include the establishment of " " a task force to assess the privacy and civil liberties implications of AI and emerging technologies " " and " " empower DHS Offices of Privacy and Civil Rights and Civil Liberties [ to ] play an integral role in the legal and approval processes for the procurement and use of Al - enabled systems.

Issue application - specific policy, as appropriate, including a Department - wide policy on facial recognition and facial detection technologies, requiring and enabling the minimization of improper bias in operational use and safeguarding of individuals against disproportionate or disparate impacts based on protected characteristics. Build on the principles articulated in EO 13960, Promoting the Use of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in the Federal Government, and leverage the ongoing work of the DHS AI Task Force (AITF) and the DHS AI Policy Working Group by establishing a DHS - specific AI risk management framework, including a focus on trustworthy and responsible AI that protects privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties and advances equity. Where reliance on an algorithm is likely to have a substantial effect on individuals, DHS will enable effective oversight through disclosure of algorithms relied upon, where appropriate; reliance on explainable algorithms when feasible; and placing an emphasis in policy and oversight activities on accountability. Sponsor a CRCL - led Responsible Use Group within the DHS AITF, to establish close coordination between the DHS AITF, the Privacy Office, and the operational and technical staff charged with leading the innovative AI projects sponsored by the AITF. The Responsible Use Group will ensure projects receive timely, tailored <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">compliance</span> and equity - enhancing policy advice and oversight scrutiny. Additionally it will work with the Department's AI Policy Working Group to leverage the lessons learned from this grass roots implementation work to inform policy and practices guiding the AITF projects, and Department - level AI governance policy, respectively. Examine the use and value of AI in meeting language access needs in DHS programs and operations through a new initiative on AI and Language Access. CRCL will convene a symposium on AI and Language Access in Fiscal Year 2024 to explore how various technologies (e.g., large language models) could address DHS mission needs for quality translation and access services while mitigating any potential harm on underserved populations. Incorporate forthcoming OMB government - wide <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">guidance</span> on AI implementation, including review of affected DHS policies protecting the individual rights and safety of the public and our employees, and updating civil rights and general individual protective policies and processes to incorporate additional protections, where appropriate. Over the next five years, continue to engage with members of underserved communities and stakeholder groups to assess the extent to which they report progressively fewer concerns about privacy and disparate treatment and impacts from DHS's AI technology, and address any lingering or novel concerns through additional policy updates. </p></article>

<p>Implement the DHS Language Access Plan and the DHS Indigenous Languages Plan to ensure that the Department's language access programs are effective. The DHS Language Access Plan applies to all DHS employees and applicable contractors that interact with members of the public. Integrate language access considerations when assessing potential barriers that underserved communities may face in accessing and benefitting from the agency's programs and activities and developing strategies to address the identified barriers. Explore how limited English proficiency impacts access to DHS programs and activities for members of underserved communities, including but not limited to Black, Latino, Indigenous and Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander persons, Indigenous migrants of Latin America, and persons with disabilities, and seek to address barriers for individuals who are LEP and belong to multiple such communities.

<p>advisory councils and committees, and uncertainty that DHS would pursue modifications to unfair practices that might require legislative fixes. To address these barriers, DHS will conduct a review of contract opportunities and grant funding opportunity announcements prior to release to determine how equitable access for tribes can be furthered; examine policy and procedures to identify updates in furtherance of security and the appropriate handling of sacred, ceremonial, or cultural items and conduct training on the same; pursue adequate staffing and other resources where needed to ensure equitable service delivery; ensure Tribal representation in DHS advisory councils, committees, and other groups; and pursue modifications to service delivery, including where legislative fixes are needed. (7) Advance equity for persons seeking humanitarian protection during immigration processing by strengthening programs available to assist them. Stakeholders continue to report concerns about processing delays and access to resources. To address these barriers, USCIS will enhance processing efficiency by leveraging technology, increasing access, and seeking opportunities to reduce fees; and DHS will strengthen resources for non - detained noncitizens released on an alternative to detention program and create process efficiencies across the board. (8) Advance equity in the FEMA Individual Assistance (IA) program to increase participation of undeserved communities. In response to FEMA's 2021 Request for Information (RFI) on FEMA Programs, <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">Regulations</span>, and Policies and associated public meetings, members of the public suggested changes to the IA program. All relevant comments received in response to the RFI, including those received during the public meetings, have been posted to the public rulemaking docket on the Federal eRulemaking portal. To address barriers and suggested changes raised by stakeholders, FEMA will publish an Interim Final Rule (IFR) amending its <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">regulations</span> governing the IA program to increase equity by simplifying processes, removing barriers to entry, and increasing eligibility for certain types of assistance under the program. (9) Advance equity through Community Disaster Resilience Zones. FEMA's National Advisory Council has found that smaller, less affluent communities with fewer resources cannot access funding to appropriately prepare for a disaster, which leads to inadequate response and recovery and little opportunity for mitigation. To address this barrier, FEMA will enhance and expand Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) Program technical assistance; implement Benefit - Cost Analysis (BCA) enhancements for all relevant mitigation programs, including incorporating equity weights into BCA; and develop a Recovery and Resilience Resource Portal, which provides ideas and information on available funding opportunities for state, local, Tribal, and territorial (SLTT) partners and community decision - makers. </p></article>

<p>1. Applying for Naturalization. USCIS began a comprehensive review of policies, <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">regulations</span>, forms, and operations to identify barriers that may impede access to naturalization by underserved communities and is undertaking efforts to reduce or eliminate those barriers. In October 2022, USCIS updated Form N - 648 (Medical Certification for Disability Exceptions) and related Policy Manual <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">guidance</span>. Applicants for naturalization with physical or developmental disability or mental impairments may request an exception to the English and civics testing requirements for naturalization. This form and Policy Manual update streamline the process for applicants to claim and substantiate a disability by eliminating unnecessary and duplicative questions. In March 2023, USCIS updated Policy Manual <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">guidance</span> to allow individuals requesting immigration benefits to self - select their gender marker (" " Male " " or " " Female " ") without the need to provide proof of their gender identity or to match the gender listed on their supporting documentation. This update reflects an important step toward reducing administrative burdens on applicants and increasing accessibility to immigration benefits and services. 2. Accessing Humanitarian Protection During Immigration Processing. DHS improved access to humanitarian protection during immigration processing by addressing language and disability access gaps and enhancing access to legal information and resources. In July 2022, USCIS issued new language access <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">guidance</span> to ensure that LEP individuals seeking asylum who cannot be interviewed in the credible fear screening process are placed into removal proceedings where an immigration judge can apply appropriate language access safeguards as that individual seeks relief. The USCIS Language Services Branch (LSB) has prioritized reaching the most vulnerable populations, including victims of trafficking, in their languages and in a culturally appropriate manner. This work, which spanned two fiscal years and involved multiple language specialists, resulted in approximately 1,000 pages of translation.

<p>Benefit applicants, both overseas and domestic, sometimes have difficulty attending USCIS appointments when the distance needed to travel is long. There are barriers related to transportation, health and safety, and finances. In FY 2023, USCIS's Refugee, Asylum, and International Operations (RAIO) began increasing the use of video technology to conduct I - 589 asylum interviews domestically, and I - 590 refugee interviews internationally, SO that applicants living in remote locations will not have to wait SO long or travel SO far. USCIS is currently drafting a proposed rule that would codify RAIO's flexibility to conduct remote interviews with refugee applicants abroad. In March 2023, USCIS published an extension to the Asylum Interpreter Temporary Final Rule (TFR) that allowed USCIS to provide telephonic interpreters for asylum applicants who speak one of 47 listed languages through September 12, 2023. Telephonic interpreters can also be connected to video interviews SO that remote interviews can be completed. The TFR temporarily reduced barriers for asylum applicants to attend and complete their interviews. There is a significant backlog of pending petitions for U nonimmigrant status due, in part, to the annual <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">statutory</span> cap limiting approvals to 10,000 principal petitions per fiscal year. As this backlog of over 250,000 filings are solely filed via paper and postal mail, USCIS is considering ways to leverage technology to improve processing to provide Employment Authorization Documents and deferred action for U petitioners and their derivatives with pending filings. As noted in the U.S. National Plan to End Gender - Based Violence, immigrant survivors face increased barriers to economic stability. They often encounter delayed processing times when applying for special immigration remedies for GBV victims that were established through VAWA and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, such as the VAWA self - petition, the U nonimmigrant status for eligible victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and qualifying eligible crimes, and the T nonimmigrant status for eligible victims of a severe form of trafficking in persons. Delays in access to work authorization and public benefits for which an individual is potentially eligible, such as housing assistance or health care, can increase vulnerabilities to abuse and undermine recovery and healing. For refugees living in many parts of the world to access the US Refugee Admissions Program, they need to be interviewed and processed by USCIS while they are overseas, which presents many logistical and travel challenges for both the refugees and USCIS staff. When USCIS has no permanent presence in a geographic area, processing occurs when USCIS has the staff to make several international trips to complete different processing steps, thereby increasing the processing time. There are numerous steps involved in processing benefits for refugee populations, such as medical exams, refugee interviews, finalization of the decision, and assurances for placement with domestic resettlement agencies. These steps typically take place sequentially and may take a long time in between steps. Noncitizen workers are particularly vulnerable to workplace abuses including unpaid wages, discrimination, health and safety violations, and reprisals for seeking to improve working conditions. In addition, noncitizen workers are often afraid to report violations to labor enforcement agencies or participate in labor standards investigations for fear of immigration - related retaliation or threats of deportation by their employers. </p></article>

In response to RFI comments, FEMA updated its policies to accept additional forms of documentation to verify occupancy and ownership requirements to reduce barriers to access experienced by underserved populations. Disaster survivors who have serious needs for emergency food, water, infant formula, diapers, or other essentials may experience a period of hardship due to a lack of access to credit or savings. FEMA will publish an IFR that will establish additional eligible assistance for serious needs. All relevant comments received in response to the request for information, including those received during the public meetings, have been posted to the public rulemaking docket on the Federal rulemaking portal. </p></article>

The team partnered with ICE to deliver designs for a website, tentatively called the " " ICE Portal, " " providing consolidated information to noncitizens regarding required check - ins, court dates, and other important information. User research will be conducted internally and in partnership with nongovernmental organizations (NGO) to ensure that the website is usable and meets the needs of the intended audience, including individuals who are LEP and individuals with disabilities. Partnering with community organizations to gather user feedback on the design, language, and accessibility helps to understand the needs of noncitizens. CXD has also partnered with CBP to improve the user experience of the CBP One mobile application, by enabling noncitizens to schedule appointments prior to arriving at a port of entry. Finally, CXD convened a multi - agency working group to work on the Secretary's priority to develop and implement a research - driven framework for communications to ensure noncitizens understand what their status and responsibilities are while in removal proceedings. </p></article>

<p>In April 2023, the Biden - Harris Administration published an evidence - informed, multi - year Alternatives, Rehabilitation, and Reentry Strategic Plan to strengthen public safety by reducing unnecessary criminal justice system interactions SO police officers can focus on fighting crime, supporting rehabilitation during incarceration, and facilitating successful reentry. DHS has committed to carry out the plan's goals of supporting rehabilitation during incarceration and facilitating successful reentry into society for individuals leaving incarceration. Workers who need access to secure areas of the nation's maritime facilities and vessels, such as ports, port facilities and warehouses, outer continental shelf facilities, certain manufacturing facilities, and certain vessels must have a Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC), as required by the Maritime Transportation Security Act. However, people with criminal history records may be unsure of their eligibility for the TWIC or may be unaware that they can seek redress if they believe their application for a TWIC was initially denied based upon incorrect information. DHS has electronically published general information on the TWIC, <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">guidance</span> on TWIC eligibility (including for those with criminal history records), how to apply for a TWIC, and opportunities to seek redress if a TWIC is initially denied. </p></article>

<p>Past and recent research like the 2030 Census Request For Information (RFI) has documented the need for and importance of Census Bureau efforts to improve coverage rates for Historically Undercounted Populations (HUPs). For instance, in 2022, the Census Bureau released results from the Post Enumeration Survey and Demographic Analysis, which produced estimates showing that the 2020 Census undercounted some populations (e.g., the Black or African American population, the American Indian or Alaska Native population living on a reservation, young children 0 to 4 years old, etc.), which underscores the value of advancing research to help the Census Bureau accurately count and describe HUPs. Al systems can reflect and amplify systemic and human biases present in the organizations and communities that develop, deploy, and use them. AI systems can also manifest statistical and computational biases. This can cause them to underperform for some groups relative to others, as in facial recognition, or to treat groups differently. Studies have shown that these phenomena have led to disparate outcomes in employment, housing, credit scoring, health care, and finance. Some private sector actors as well as public <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">regulators</span> have indicated the need to adjust their work in response to Al - related bias and discrimination. </p></article>

<p>The most persistent barrier to the establishment, expansion, and growth of minority business enterprises (MBEs) continues to be access to capital. The U.S. Federal Reserve found that more than half of Black - owned businesses were turned down for private bank loans, a rate twice as high as white business owners. A Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies study found that 6 in 10 Black business owners faced challenges obtaining capital. Over a third of Latino business owners faced the same. Business owners of color were more likely to struggle to access startup funding, growth funding, and capital with affordable interest rates. In 2022, in the U.S., only 1.9 percent of venture capital dollars went to all - women teams; less than. 5 percent went to Black and Brown women; only 12 percent of venture capital decision - makers are women. Innovation fueled economic growth in America for the past century, but since the 1970s, innovation (as measured by fundamental productivity growth) appears to have slowed from an annual increase of 1.9 percent to 0.7 percent. Research shows that innovation in the U.S. could quadruple if women, minorities, and children from low - income families became inventors at the same rate as men from high - income families. According to the USPTO, that increase in inventorship would grow our economy and GDP by an estimated $ 1 trillion. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, fewer than 1 percent of minority - owned businesses export goods or services. For these enterprises, insufficient financial resources often hinder their ability to invest in overseas market exploration, navigate <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">regulatory</span> complexities, and establish international networks. </p></article>

<p>Current metric collection fails to holistically assess justice outcomes in DOE R & D programs. Current <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Justice40">Justice40</span> metrics do not capture R & D impacts outside of the geographical location where work is being performed. Further, some types of R & D funding (non - competitive / block grants, DOE Laboratory solicitations, Lab field work proposals) do not have metrics in place to monitor and measure project progress. <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Justice40">Justice40</span> metric reporting is hindered by limited coordination and some offices lacking trained and task - dedicated personnel to measure program impacts. The nature of R & D makes outcome - based metric reporting difficult. Outcome - based metrics are data that show the extent and impact of an organization's, program's, or initiative's activities on its customers or beneficiaries. 5 Outcome - based metrics are different from performance metrics, which track the key activities that lead to outcomes, or output or activity data, which describe the organization's actions. 6 Outcome - based metrics are useful for demonstrating accountability, transparency, and efficacy. 7 The benefits of R & D can have long time horizons and broad applications. In general, technology R & D strategy roadmaps lack sufficient consideration of equity or justice. Current roadmaps emphasize technological advancement of high - performance, high - cost technologies that likely will not be affordable to underserved communities. For example, clean energy and energy efficiency programs (e.g., rooftop solar power, weatherization) are not accessible to some underserved and underrepresented communities, especially where there is a reliance upon technology to communicate and access these programs.

<p>Although inconsistent, several offices across DOE have collected R & D impact metrics, such as the number of peer - reviewed journal articles, patents, licenses, new companies formed, and the amount of follow - on funding received from the private sector. Challenges to these current efforts include: Many of these achievements occur after a project is closed out, when awardees are no longer reporting on the project and have likely moved onto other projects. As a result, many of these outputs are not appropriately attributed to DOE funding. One study of the Web of Science - a public database of scientific articles - found that in some subject areas, as little as 28 % of the articles had any acknowledgements, and of those only 65 % acknowledged funding. 9 If funding is properly acknowledged, web - crawling techniques can be used to extract subsequent impacts. Existing project impact metrics fail to address equity or justice. There are infrequent third - party reviews of evaluation metrics. These reviews are costly, time - intensive, and limited by confidential business information restrictions. There is limited interaction and participation with citizen / community science in the development of DOE R & D strategies and metrics. There have been several approaches across the federal Government to address the foregoing challenges: In the Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (<span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="American Rescue Plan">ARPA</span> - E), there are staff who follow up with past recipients to collect research outputs / publications. In the DOE Office of Science, there is an annual automated reminder to past awardees to update their profile, including information regarding publications. Existing literature shows a lack of equity consideration in R & D metrics. To fill this gap, NREL developed the Justice Underpinning Science and Technology Research (JUST - R) metrics framework - energy justice metrics specifically targeted at early - stage research. 10 Some offices have project - specific metrics. For example, DOE's Building Technology Office requires applicants of some FOAs to provide estimates of energy, cost, and emissions savings using the Resilient and Efficient Codes Implementation (RECI) Impact Calculator tool - a spreadsheet - based tool for building code updates in new construction, improvements to existing buildings, and improvements in energy codes <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">compliance</span>. 11 Since climate change disproportionately impacts low - income and minority </p></article>

Progress on increasing opportunities for new applicants to DOE funding opportunities. Office of Management, OAM OAM implemented a strategy with M & O contractors and major site and facility contractors designed to increase subcontracting opportunities from contractors who employ people who are blind or have significant disabilities (AbilityOne). As a result of this implementation, DOE - wide AbilityOne obligations increased from $ 27.5M in FY 2022 to $ 31.2M in FY 2023, an increase of 13 %. OAM continues to co - lead the Innovative Funding Mechanisms Working Group with the Office of General Counsel, which is exploring innovative mechanisms to increase participation in DOE funding opportunities. The Working Group has focused on Partnership Intermediary Agreements (PIAs) and Other Transactions (OT) Authority as possible pathways to reach underrepresented entities and communities. PIAs are best utilized when traditional contractual mechanisms do not provide adequate outreach with non - traditional contractors and can reduce barriers to entry for such entities.

<p>Current approaches to awarding DOE procurement opportunities lead to inequitable outcomes among economically disadvantaged groups. The Department of Energy, along with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP), co - sponsored two nation - wide crowdsourcing campaigns, and found that women - owned small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, minority - owned small businesses, veteran - owned small businesses; Tribal - owned and Native American - owned small businesses; and Historically Under - utilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses lack clarity on procurement and subcontracting (and other funding mechanisms) opportunities, processes, and procedures.

<p>Difficulty Finding Opportunities. Through ongoing engagement with small vendors - small, small disadvantaged, women - owned small, service - disabled veteran owned small businesses, businesses located in historically underutilized business zones, and ISBEEs DOI has repeatedly helped vendors who convey that learning about contracting opportunities can be challenging, especially for new or inexperienced businesses. New entrants to the Federal procurement process lack experience and understanding of how to access opportunities and the various methods that DOI uses to procure goods and services. Communication. During DOI's listening sessions, participants indicated frustration with the communication between the Department and vendors, including identifying the appropriate individuals within Bureaus to help them, response rates, and obtaining information about specific opportunities before and after award. In addition, outreach - especially in - person outreach - can be limited by geography and established networks, which may also present barriers for some businesses. Process Complexity. During DOI's listening sessions, participants provided input regarding the complexity of the procurement process, with each step governed by <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">statute</span> and <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">regulations</span> that may differ from commercial contracting. It can be particularly challenging for new or inexperienced businesses to understand requirements, terms and conditions in solicitations, and other elements of the process. Limited opportunities to gain experience and / or training on the process may present barriers to some businesses. Departmental Procedures. Ensuring Departmental processes and policies contribute to an equitable distribution of awards to underserved communities is a critical component to achieving equity in Federal procurement. Based on the barriers identified above - awareness of procurement opportunities and communication with vendors - preliminary review of DOI policy, feedback from listening sessions, and survey results, the Department identified the following process and policy as a focus area for additional targeted review and analysis: Publicizing procurement actions. Communication with vendors throughout the acquisition process, such as communication with vendors who were unsuccessful at securing an award during debriefing. </p></article>

<p>Modify the way existing programs are implemented to emphasize the importance of delivering benefits to underserved communities and design new programs equitably, which will ensure that a greater portion of funds flow to those communities. Examples include: For the ORLP, NPS specified the following criteria for emphasis to be considered in the evaluation of proposals for awards in FY 2023: (1) environmental justice, (2) urban heat map areas, and (3) military outdoor recreation. The LWCF State Assistance Program provides grants to States to support the acquisition of land and the development of facilities for public outdoor recreation. The NPS - revised LWCF State Manual, which lays out the requirements for State participation in the program, asks States to be more intentional in selecting LWCF projects that are in alignment with <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Justice40">Justice40</span> Initiative goals and direct States to use the <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Justice40">Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool</span> in project selection. In order for States to participate in the LWCF program, they must prepare a Statewide Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan that outlines how they will implement the program.

<p>Revise Departmental and Bureau policies to make environmental justice considerations an essential part of the decision - making process, which will help shape program development and implementation to have a greater focus on environmental justice. Examples include: Update the Department's environmental justice policy as stated in the Departmental Manual to reflect EO 14008, entitled " " Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad " " and EO 14096, entitled " " Revitalizing Our Nations Commitment to Environmental Justice for All. " " Create <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">guidance</span> documents for the use of science and data in environmental decision - making to incorporate data related to environmental justice and Indigenous Knowledge, along with an environmental justice science and data integrated decision model.

" ", which is based on feedback received at numerous listening sessions and through public comments that will result in more equitable outcomes by ensuring that the voices of Indigenous communities and communities with environmental justice concerns are part of the decision - making process. The BLM issued an " " Instruction Memorandum about Environmental Justice Implementation " " and " " Addressing Environmental Justice in NEPA FAQs " " in September 2022. These documents update and formalize best practices while recommending methods for scoping, outreach, and analysis in environmental reviews. These policies will help guide BLM staff in implementing environmental justice and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Justice40">Justice40</span> Initiative and will serve as examples for other Bureaus to develop policies.

Priority learning question 4.4 in the Department's FY 2022 - 2026 Learning Agenda asked, " " How can the Department increase stakeholder engagement to improve environmental justice outcomes for infrastructure investments? " " Examples include: Develop a stakeholder relationship management platform to reduce stakeholder fatigue and help staff across the Department learn about the needs communities identify during engagements and consultations. This will lead to more equitable outcomes by increasing the effectiveness and usefulness of engagements. Provide technical assistance for grant writing and grant writers, which we have learned from listening sessions and public comment is an important tool for reducing the barriers to participating in funding opportunities. Work with on - the - ground partners that can help guide and direct our outreach to communities who need it most. For example, the Office of Native Hawaiian Relations has been working with certain Native Hawaiian Organizations (NHOs) that have facilitated outreach to other NHOs and portions of the community that have not historically applied for or received funding from the Department due to capacity issues or other barriers to participation. This outreach helps inform program design to reach those communities.

<p>A. 2022 Equity Action Plan Update Pursuant to EO 13985, 2 the Department of Justice published its first ever Equity Action Plan in April 2022. Since then, the Department has made significant progress implementing its equity priorities by improving solicitation processes, increasing opportunities for disadvantaged small businesses located in Historically Underutilized Business Zones, and strengthening mechanisms for community engagement, among others. Specific examples of the Department's ongoing progress in advancing its 2022 equity priorities include: Strengthening efforts to ensure <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">compliance</span> and enforcement of non - discrimination laws. Following review of implementation and administrative enforcement of the non - discrimination provisions set forth in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act ³ and the Safe Streets Act4 in connection with Federal financial assistance, the Department is taking affirmative steps to improve this work. 5 For example, the Civil Rights Division (CRT) and the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) created and co - chair a <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">Compliance</span> Working Group to coordinate the implementation and enforcement of these <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">statutes</span>, issue public <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">guidance</span>, revise internal standards, update tools and resources, and conduct public outreach. 6 Enhancing language access for individuals with limited English proficiency. In May 2022, DOJ hired its first - ever Language Access Coordinator (Coordinator). Since then, DOJ's Coordinator has reestablished the Language Access Working Group, which meets regularly, is comprised of representatives from various DOJ components, and provides a platform to support, guide, and oversee components ' efforts to increase meaningful access SO that communities can better access DOJ programs, communicate public safety concerns, and vindicate their rights. For example, DOJ recently published its FY 2022 - 2026 Strategic Plan in Spanish and key excerpts were published in Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, and Tagalog. In August 2023, the Department also released its updated Language Access Plan, which improves translation and interpretation services, promotes quality assurance of those services, and expands the range of tools available to serve the public. The Department has made significant progress in advancing environmental justice as measured through the agency's performance on the Environmental Justice Scorecard. This progress includes: (1) analyzing how to best enforce the non - discrimination provisions under Title VI; (2) prioritizing environmental justice in DOJ's decision - making processes through the creation of the Office of Environmental Justice (OEJ), development and implementation of a new Comprehensive Environmental Justice Enforcement Strategy, and engagement with communities with environmental justice concerns, including Tribal nations; and (3) institutionalizing environmental justice by developing DOJ resources and training, increasing staff capacity, and strengthening </p></article>

<p>Combating hate crimes and hate incidents. The Department has increased multilingual resources to combat hate crimes through Federal law enforcement action and enhanced training, support, and outreach to State and local partners. For example, DOJ has further prioritized civil rights violations and hate crimes enforcement among the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) field offices. As of September 2023, DOJ launched the United Against Hate program in all 94 U.S. Attorneys ' Offices (USAOs) to help improve the reporting of hate crimes by informing communities on how to identify, report, and help prevent hate crimes, and to encourage trust building between law enforcement and communities. 10 Reforming law enforcement practices. Pursuant to EO 14074, 11 DOJ is executing on more than 90 Executive Order deliverables to advance effective, fair, and constitutional policing; improve conditions of confinement and reentry; promote officer safety and wellness; and improve data collection and analysis. This work includes prohibiting the transfer or purchase of military - style weapons and equipment to State, Tribal, Local and Territorial (STLT) law enforcement agencies (LEAs), administering grants in a manner that is consistent with the adoption of EO 14074 ' s policies, creating accreditation standards to help encourage STLT LEAs to adopt policies consistent with the EO, and working to establish the National Law Enforcement Accountability Database. DOJ also released a Strategic Plan for supporting the goals of the Federal Interagency Alternatives and Reentry Committee, which seeks to safely reduce criminal justice system interactions, support rehabilitation during incarceration, and facilitate successful reentry. 12 Lastly, DOJ has invested in state - and local - level correctional services, including by supporting correctional and educational institutions as they enhance post - secondary educational opportunities in prisons following the reinstatement of Pell Grant eligibility for incarcerated students in July 2023. The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is also expanding access to Pell Grants within Federal correctional facilities to help incarcerated students earn college credits and / or a college degree.

<p>5. Advanced equity in grant process strategies through funding programs that focused on improving access to high - quality educational opportunities and programs that pursue innovations in teaching and learning with an emphasis on underserved students. Designated the $ 1 billion from the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA) as the Stronger Connections Grant Program. This enables SEAs to competitively award subgrants to high - need LEAs for activities to support safe and healthy students under ESEA section 4108. Funded 264 grants with $ 1 billion in BSCA funds to more than 40 states to increase the supply of school - based mental health professionals under the School - Based Mental Health Services Grant and the Mental Health Services Professional Demonstration (MHSPD) Grant Program. At least 40 States used " " high poverty " " in their definition of high - needs school. The Department estimates these 5 - year grants will result in an increase of 14,000 mental health professionals. In FY23, nearly 50 percent of the MHSPD grants include a partnership with MSIs, HBCUs, or Tribal Colleges. In a letter to State educational agencies, the Department encouraged states to prioritize funding for districts with high rates of poverty and one of the following a high student - to - mental health professional ratio; high rates of chronic absenteeism, exclusionary discipline, and / or referrals to the juvenile justice system, bullying / harassment, community and school violence, or substance abuse; or students who recently experienced a natural disaster or traumatic event. The Department issued revised non - <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">regulatory guidance</span> to inform SEAs, LEAs, institutions of higher education, schools, educators, partner organizations, and other stakeholders on how they can use evidence - based activities, strategies, and interventions to strengthen education investments.

<p>Education can have a transformational impact on an individual's life - and education plays a vital role in easing an individual's reentry from jail or prison back into society. Studies have found that a postsecondary education helps justice - impacted people who were formerly incarcerated find jobs upon release, support their families, and contribute positively to their communities. Research also shows that access to education in prison lowers the odds of recidivating by 43 percent and saves taxpayers up to $ 5 for every $ 1 spent. 26 However, policies have traditionally exacerbated the barriers that incarcerated people face when attempting to continue their education, including inadequate funding, local labor market trends and employer needs, <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">statutory</span> and administrative restrictions, and a lack of incentives and support to promote participation in education. 27 </p></article>

<p>In March 2022, reached a settlement with Chevron Phillips Chemical Company to install and operate air pollution controls at three petrochemical manufacturing facilities in Texas located in areas of environmental justice concern; monitoring results will be publicly posted, and corrective actions are required if emissions exceed certain thresholds. Took aggressive, early enforcement actions in communities with environmental justice concerns: In August 2022, following negotiations that considered concerns voiced by the local community, secured a preliminary injunction for the Toa Alta Municipal Solid Waste Landfill to take immediate action to address urgent human health and environmental concerns. Issued two Clean Air Act emergency orders to shut down the Limetree Refinery in the U.S. Virgin Islands (June 2021) where residents were sickened by excess sulfur and hydrogen sulfide emissions and to cut hydrogen sulfide emissions from the New Indy plant in South Carolina (May 2021). Provided more enforcement information to communities about facilities, pollution, and enforcement activities through press releases, desk statements, public meetings, and websites focused on specific communities and incidents (e.g., Refinery on St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, H2S in South and North Carolina, Toa Alta Landfill in Puerto Rico). Increased efforts to obtain input from communities on potential remedies prior to finalizing settlement agreements. Developed analytical approaches to address environmental justice implications of major <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">regulatory</span> proposals and final rules. For example, For the Oil and Natural Gas New Source Performance Standard proposal (November 2021) and the Supplemental Proposal (November 2022), EPA held virtual trainings (900 + participants) marketed to communities with environmental justice concerns and Tribes to assist their ability to understand and comment meaningfully on the proposal. EPA's proposal included requirements for states to undertake meaningful outreach and engagement with communities with environmental justice concerns as they develop their plans for <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">regulating</span> existing oil and gas sources under the emissions guidelines. In the final nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission standards for trucks, conducted analyses of the number and demographics of the populations living within close proximity to truck freight routes. This final rule will likely result in widespread air quality improvements across the U.S., especially in areas already overburdened by air pollution and diesel emissions, beginning with model year 2027. In July 2023, issued proposed rules to strengthen lead paint standards to protect against childhood lead exposure. Developed a Strategy to Reduce Lead Exposures and Disparities in US Communities to advance EPA's work to protect the public from lead with an emphasis on high - risk communities. Announced the allotment of $ 2.865B FY 2023 funds from the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund for identification and replacement of lead service lines (LSLs). As part of the Lead Service Line Replacement (LSLR) Accelerators, EPA and 4 state partners are working with 40 communities to address existing barriers and accelerate progress towards LSL identification and replacement. The new Accelerator provides targeted technical assistance services to help communities with environmental justice concerns access funds from President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law4 and this initiative will prioritize benefits to communities with EJ concerns and promote equity. Provided Spanish Lead Awareness Curriculum for Indian Country. </p></article>

<p>subgrants to communities in their regional coverage areas in amounts between $ 100 - 350K. These subgrants will essentially replace EPA's traditional grant programs such as the EJ Small Grants, which would provide such small levels of support directly to communities through a traditional government grant competition and award process. The subawards through the Grantmakers will achieve two equity goals - greatly reducing the burden capacity - constrained communities face when seeking small amounts of funding directly from the federal government, and also increasing the speed with which communities receive an award. EPA plans to make at least eleven (11) Grantmaker awards across the United States with $ 50M each, of which at least $ 40M must be directly subawarded to capacity - constrained communities. EPA anticipates that over the next three years the Grantmakers will make approximately 2,000 subawards in the amounts cited. EPA has announced the eleven (11) recipients of the EJ TCGM awards totaling $ 600M. Launched a new $ 2B Environment and Climate Justice Community Change Grant program with a focus on re - envisioning the application process to ensure equity. In FY 2024, EPA will compete these new Community Change Grants, which will be the vehicle through which approximately $ 2B in <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Inflation Reduction Act">IRA</span> funding will flow. Community Change Grants will focus on awarding between $ 10 - 20M to multi - faceted proposals from community - driven collaborations that bring together efforts to deal with legacy pollution, the impacts of climate change, development of local workforces, meaningful engagement, community education - all with a goal of implementing solutions that create positive change on the ground for communities. EPA is implementing several innovative solutions to increase equity through this program. While the EJ TCTACs will focus on providing more basic forms of support to capacity - constrained communities, they will also facilitate communities with higher levels of capacity to access more specialized forms of technical assistance provided by contractors. This contractor - provided technical assistance will offer communities the support they need for planning, project development, financing, etc. in the development of multi - faceted proposals for the Community Change Grant program. Technical assistance by the contractor will also support proposals that receive support to ensure high quality reporting, tracking, and telling the story of how the Community Change Grants catalyzed positive and meaningful change on the ground for the recipient communities. The Community Change Grant program will have a two - stage application process. The first stage will be a more traditional written application that is streamlined to the extent feasible to ease the burden on applicants. Proposals that meet minimum criteria in the paper application will then be invited to an oral presentation that will achieve two goals - minimize the role that professional grant writers play for typically better - resourced communities and allow EPA grants staff to engage directly with community leaders and their partners to investigate the authenticity of the project's community - driven nature and the sustainability ensured by different partners of the project. In addition - to ease the burden on communities - the Community Change Grant will have a 12 - month open application period. This will achieve several equity goals. It will provide communities significantly more time to build the partnerships and multi - faceted proposals sought through this competition. It will allow EPA program staff the opportunity to tailor the competition over the year - long window based upon feedback from prospective applicants and the actual proposals received to ensure that the competition fits the needs and purpose as closely as possible.

<p>Gaps in capacity and coordination within the federal family to support economic revitalization, infrastructure improvements, and other community - specific needs. Rural communities can include underserved persons who experience inconsistent access to safe drinking water and sanitation services, due to either personal resources (e.g., homeowner well or septic system) or lack of ratepayers for public system maintenance or improvements. Rural economies are more dependent on natural resources, which may be disproportionately affected by pollution, chemical exposures, and from climate change. Rural communities may receive inequitable access to information and EPA opportunities (e.g., unreliable internet access). When equity screening information is needed or encouraged for competitive funding opportunities, a lack of robust data can inadvertently disadvantage rural communities ' ability to successfully compete for these resources (e.g., identification of communities in EJScreen and other screening tools).

To carry out its mission, EPA is committed to developing and implementing concrete policies and activities to advance equity and environmental justice across its programs. This can only be achieved by acknowledging that many communities across the country have not sufficiently benefitted from EPA's decades of progress in reducing pollution and breaking down barriers to equity. EPA strives to infuse the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals into all EPA programs, policies, and activities. EPA's commitment to equity and environmental justice forms a critical foundation on which to build meaningful engagement with communities with environmental justice concerns; achieve more equitable and just outcomes, including pollution reductions in communities with environmental justice concerns; and deliver other tangible benefits. In remaining faithful to these commitments, EPA is living up to the promise to protect human health and the environment made to all people in the United States and its territories when the Agency was created more than 50 years ago. </p></article>

<p>Although technology continues to rapidly evolve, persistent inequities in technology design and delivery - like higher false rejection rates, completion failure rates, and time burdens - disproportionately negatively impact those from historically and socially marginalized communities. Additionally, digital services very often fail to prioritize human - centered design and usability beyond <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">compliance</span>. This means that Americans who likely have a critical need to connect with government information and services through digital platforms also are likely to have the hardest time doing SO. Examples include both lack of access to the newest hardware or good internet, which often means newer digital platforms do not perform as well (because they are not built for older devices or don't work with low bandwidth connections), or software that is not designed to work across all populations, such as lack of plain language impacting populations with limited English proficiency or poorly trained Al models causing biometric systems to perform worse for people with different ages or skin tones. GSA - through its consulting and fellowships offerings such as the Centers of Excellence and the Presidential Innovation Fellows, shared services such as Login.gov and the US Web Design System, and Federal partners in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and United States Digital Service - plays a central role in the responsible development, deployment, and procurement of technologies used by the Federal Government to communicate or interact with the public. 4 GSA is committed to delivering high - impact digital services and products in a manner that improves customer experience, reduces burden, broadens access, and advances civic tech practices that are intrinsically equity - aware and community - informed. </p></article>

<p>CMS Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services (CMCS) engages, and consults states regularly as part of the Quality Improvement Technical Assistance work through the Maternal and Infant Health Initiative (MIHI). Group participants are encouraged to reach out to their beneficiaries to determine barriers to improving quality on metrics, such as attendance at postpartum care or infant well - child visits, transportation issues, or difficulty scheduling. These consultations help inform states of barriers encountered by beneficiaries. HHS OMH and CMS CMCS held a listening session to gather consumer feedback regarding using inclusive maternal language (especially as it relates to the word " " maternal " " and non - binary or gender conforming people). Participants included professionals with direct clinical, research, or system - level expertise on inclusive language or experience in providing affirming care for non - binary and transgender patients. One key takeaway was that Inclusive language is important to make people feel cared for by their providers. NIH sponsored the Connecting the Community for Maternal Health Challenge to encourage and reward nonprofit community - based or advocacy organizations to develop research capabilities and infrastructure to pursue maternal health research projects. The challenge offered approximately $ 3 million in prizes, distributed across multiple phases of the competition to organizations that successfully completed the objectives and requirements of each phase.

<p>A large body of literature has investigated the relationship between environmental toxins, race, and poverty. Most notably, the 1987 landmark study by Robert Bullard " " Toxic Waste and Race in the United States " " that demonstrated a correlation between the placement of toxic waste facilities and low - income Black and Brown communities Since then, several studies from interdisciplinary approaches continue to asses environmental injustices as demonstrated in Environmental Justice: The Economics of Race, Place, and Pollution or seen in the legacies from redlining and pollution. Researcher Diana Hernandez demonstrates in two papers how weatherization can be a catalyst for reducing the energy burden affecting low - income individuals and ultimately improve health and social outcomes among African Americans. Through the publications Climate Justice Starts at Home: Building Resilient Housing to Reduce Disparate Impacts From Climate Change in Residential Settings and Energy efficiency as energy justice: addressing racial inequities through investments in people and places she finds that Black households, even when disaggregating income, are more likely to live in less - efficient homes, demonstrating the legacy of housing segregation, redlining, and lack of equitable access to financing. These additional energy costs affect utility costs. She poses not just utility assistance but weatherization and green energy improvements as mechanisms to reducing environmental and economic injustices. To complement the body of literature on this topic, the White House Council on Environmental Quality developed the <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Justice40">Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool</span> (<span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Justice40">CEJST</span>) using nationally consistent data and an approach that combines environmental and demographic indicators to identify historically disadvantaged communities through an interactive map. The tool measures burdens in eight categories: climate change, energy, health, housing, legacy pollution, transportation, water and wastewater, and workforce development. Individuals seeking careers in the green construction industry often face barriers in accessing training opportunities (including apprenticeships) to become certified and / or qualified for the employment opportunities. The Center for Law and Social Policy asserts that " " women, people with disabilities, youth, and people impacted by the criminal legal system face especially egregious hiring discrimination and inequitable employment opportunities " " and that green investments can create high quality employment opportunities. </p></article>

<p>HUD works with Continuums of Care (CoC) nationally that prepare community plans to organize and deliver housing and services to meet the specific needs of people who are homeless as they move to stable housing and maximum self - sufficiency. As part of our equity focus, SNAPS conducted its second Coordinated Entry Equity Demonstration, deploying teams of technical assistance coaches to 15 Continuums of Care covering a broad range of communities. The goal of the demonstration was to design a more equitable assessment and prioritization process to improve conditions and outcomes for all Black and Brown people. The technical assistance coaching teams included providers with experience in racial equity and housing justice work, coordinated entry design, lived experience of homelessness, and navigating homeless systems and other related disciplines. In partnership with Black and Brown people as well as people with lived expertise of homelessness, CoCs identified system disparities through analyzing local data, agreed upon focus areas, and tested racially equitable coordinated entry system processes in service of significantly transforming the experience and housing stability of those disproportionately represented in local homeless responsive systems. HUD will publish <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">guidance</span> documents created from the learnings in the second demonstration on the HUD Exchange Homelessness Assistance website, and SNAPS will share a synopsis of the findings from the prior two cohorts to scale future improvements and interventions nationally. </p></article>

<p>FHA has taken additional steps through the Office of Single Family Housing (SFH) to support wealth generation activities for prospective and current homeowners.

This <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">guidance</span> is expected to continue to expand homeownership opportunities for borrowers where a positive rental payment history can make a difference when combined with other assessment factors for determining eligibility for FHA - insured mortgage financing.

<p>Through HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO), HUD has delivered key initiatives in support of equitable access to housing resources and protections. Specifically, in FY 2022, FHEO issued a memorandum titled, " " Implementation of the Office of General Counsel's <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">Guidance</span> on Application of Fair Housing Act Standards to the Use of Criminal Records by Providers of Housing and Real Estate - Related Transactions. " " This memorandum supports the Administration's commitment to protect tenant rights and reviewed fair housing principles related to the use of criminal records, highlighted the need for FHEO investigators, Fair Housing Initiatives Program grantees (FHIPs), and Fair Housing Assistance Program agencies (FHAPs) to be aware of the ways in which criminal background screening policies and practices can violate the Fair Housing Act, provided tips for conducting investigations relating to criminal background screening, and set out best practices related to the use of criminal background screening information on applicants or tenants. The issuance of this memo has been followed by the signing of Voluntary <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">Compliance</span> Agreements that serve as an example for requiring more inclusive tenant screening policies by housing providers. In October 2023, HUD published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would eliminate the agency's restrictions on the use of fair housing testers with prior felony convictions or certain other convictions by Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) grantees and Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP) agencies.

Existing category management practices and best - in - class solutions can negatively impact the ability of disadvantaged entities and new entrants to position themselves for access to compete and secure awards. Data used to validate the application of category management principles demonstrates that small businesses under category management have received a proportionally lower share of spending than others. Large contracts can increase the efficiency of contract spending, eliminate redundant agreements, and reduce administrative burdens; however, this action could adversely impact contracts available for small and disadvantaged entities and equity goals for Federal acquisitions. </p></article>

<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Asian American Foundation collaborated to support the White House Initiative on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders by introducing the " " Demystifying Federal Grants " " webinar series. This series was created to provide valuable knowledge and practical advice to assist community - based organizations in successfully applying for federal grants and accessing resources. NSF's chief diversity and inclusion officer (CDIO) has collaborated with a dedicated team of program directors (PDs) to leverage its review and awards process to ensure the Foundation's funded programs can reach the broad pool of untapped scientific talent. These discussions have yielded critical insights into how NSF can better support the inclusion of underrepresented scientists by emphasizing the importance of more general impact statements in grant applications, ensuring diversity within review panels, and increasing participation of researchers from Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). Under the June 2022 Executive Order 14075, Advancing Equality for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex (LGBTQI +) Individuals, the Office of the Chief Statistician of the United States provided recommendations for Federal agencies on best practices to collect self - reported sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data in federal statistical surveys. In an effort led by the CDIO, a dedicated team of individuals across the agency has developed a pilot survey to collect voluntary, non - personally identifiable SOGI data from within the NSF workforce. These efforts are taking place in concert with the National Council of Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) efforts to pilot the collection of SOGI data in their national surveys. D. Advancing Equity Through Key <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">Legislation</span>: NSF is committed to the principle that a diverse scientific workforce is vital to promoting advances in knowledge, innovation, and the global competitiveness of the U.S. scientific enterprise.

Issues in Science and Technology, 39 (1), 33 - 35.) notes that " " eliminating the barriers to discovery and research outputs are critically important to realizing the commitment to equity [ and the ] commitment to providing research, innovation, cures, and improved health and well - being to the nation and the world. " " A report of the General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) November 2021 meeting in Paris explains the benefits of open science ecosystems related to the equity and sustainable development goals and formally recommends that member states " " collaborate in bilateral, regional, multilateral and global initiatives for the advancement of open science. " " The report recommends the creation of, encouraging or enabling policy environment, to which implementation of NSF's public access plan would contribute, and notes that " " a paywalled method of publication, where immediate access to scientific publications is only granted in exchange for payment, is not aligned with the present Recommendation. " " Input derived from NSF participation in the Subcommittee on Open Science (SOS) and deliverables from the subgroups of the SOS. In addition to recognizing the positive equity impact of public access policies, NSF recognizes potential equity challenges that could arise from public access implementation. The NSF Public Access and Open Science Working Group's Equity of Access subgroup addresses this issue by identifying potential inequities arising from public access guidelines at different implementation phases. The literature points to four specific areas of equity challenges: (1) challenges for researchers and institutions based on resources available for public access implementation; (2) challenges based on methodologies and disciplines based on variation in public access infrastructure; (3) challenges for historically marginalized groups for whom critical issues of reclamation of rights and data sovereignty exist; and (4) challenges for international collaborations due to variation in international <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">regulations</span> and practices in data sharing. To address these challenges, NSF has identified four priority areas to manifest the equity promises of public access policies and minimize challenges. Actions include: Consult with Pls and institutions to understand and respond to potential equity challenges. A key priority is focusing on under - represented and under - resourced institutions and the potential for increases in public access implementation costs. Understanding and measuring investment in public access compliance's financial and non - financial costs must improve. It remains unclear what the magnitude and distribution of costs </p></article>

<p>According to a participant survey following the pilot " " Level Up to Public Service " " event, 63 % of the students expressed interest in pursuing a career in the Federal government before the event, and this figure rose to 78 % after the event. This 15 percentage - point increase in interest indicates that this event enhanced awareness of and fostered interest in careers within the public service sector among college students from underrepresented communities. Students who are aware of Federal job opportunities face challenges with the application process. OPM's ODEIA has partnered with institutions of higher education, including HBCUs and other MSIs, and have collected reports from student participants that have indicated there are challenges accessing and support in submitting applications for Federal internships and early career positions. Specifically, the following challenges have been reported to various Federal Chief Diversity Officers government - wide: Students have limited exposure to or awareness of public service opportunities; Students are experiencing challenges finding appropriate internships that support individual career goals; Students need specific training to complete the Federal application process; Students prefer internship opportunities that support their career goals, while also meeting their financial obligations. OPM, the Department of Labor, and OMB recently developed and launched a new portal on USAJOBS for prospective Federal interns.

<p>Federal employees and retirees face increasing health care premiums (as a percentage of income) and difficulty affording paying their share of premiums, as well as health plan copayments and coinsurance. These increases disproportionately impact lower wage Federal employees and retirees as there is no adjustment to reflect differences in family incomes. The government contribution toward FEHB enrollee premium is set in <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">statute</span>. These contributions are the lesser of 72 percent of the weighted average premium of all plans or 75 percent of the premium of the plan chosen by the enrollee. The government contribution formula makes no distinction between the grade or salary level of the Federal employee or the amount of the annuitant's annuity payment. In other words, a Senior Executive enrolled in Blue Cross Basic pays the same self only premium as the GS - 5 enrolled in the same plan, even though the Senior Executive may earn three times the pay of the GS - 5. Similarly, health plan cost sharing at time of service, deductibles, and the maximum out of pocket payment allowed are not adjusted based on enrollee income or grade. The FEHB Program does not currently have information on the family income of individual employees or retirees to enable targeting of the FEHB benefit to those with lower incomes, and further research is needed to understand what factors affect non - enrollment and how employees perceive affordability. </p></article>

Available evidence suggests that some eligible Federal employees are not taking the full PPL benefits that are available to them through the Federal Employee Paid Leave Act (FEPLA).

Under current policy, ISM refers to reported or estimated assistance with food and / or shelter provided to SSI claimants from others within or outside their households. We determine claimants ' eligibility for and amount of SSI payments, partially based on the amount of ISM they receive. Simplifying ISM policies will make the SSI program easier for the public to understand and less burdensome for us to administer, and reduce the potential for improper payments. Omitting Food from ISM Calculation: Removes food from the calculation of ISM. Food assistance received from others will no longer impact claimants ' benefit eligibility and amount. (NPRM. Feb. 15, 2023. 88 FR 9779.) Expansion of the Rental Subsidy Policy for SSI Applicants and Recipients: Expands rental subsidy exemption currently applicable in seven States nationwide, exempting claimants from ISM from other household members if they pay at least one third of the SSI benefit on rent. (NPRM. Aug. 24, 2023. 88 FR 57910.) Expand the Definition of a Public Assistance (PA) Household: Adds Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to the list of means - tested programs included in our definition of PA households; if every household member receives at least one of the specified types of assistance, we would not reduce SSI benefits due to ISM or deeming from other household members.

These past - due benefits are considered underpayments and may be subject to installments. In post - entitlement situations, underpayments are generally the result of reporting delays. For example, people receiving SSI payments are required to timely report any changes in their medical or non - medical (i.e., income, resources, or living arrangements) circumstances that may impact their payments. When a person receiving SSI payments does not timely report changes that will affect their payment amount, the field office will update the record noting a discrepancy, which may cause an underpayment. If an underpayment exceeds three times the Federal Benefit Rate, the payment due to the recipient is subject to installments. 23 </p></article>

<p>When women's rights are viewed as a separate issue from human rights, or gender equality is misconstrued as a threat to the enjoyment of all human rights, the sovereignty of states, or national values and traditions, democracy as both a political system and shared societal commitment to fundamental values cannot flourish. Over the last decade, anti - women's rights movements have become more visible, vocal, widespread, and successful and are often tied to pushback on broader human rights issues. These movements are transnational in nature and associated with or supported by authoritarian regimes that seek to attain or retain power, contributing to global democratic backsliding. Per Freedom House's annual Freedom in the World report, 2022 marked 16 consecutive years of democratic decline. These movements and authoritarian regimes, such as the governments of Russia and the People's Republic of China, strive to dismantle human rights institutions and instruments, employ disinformation aimed to fuel identity politics, and promote discriminatory national <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">legislation</span> - encouraging and supporting other countries to do the same. </p></article>

<p>Around the world, members of marginalized and underserved communities are on the frontlines of global challenges - from economic and social inequality to the climate crisis to threats to democracy, peace, and stability. Members of marginalized and underserved communities are often excluded from political participation and economic development and subjected to discriminatory laws, <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">regulation</span>, and practices in their countries, which erodes the rule of law and democratic governance. Often, these communities cannot safely and sustainably access and participate in U.S. diplomatic engagements and programs nor inform U.S. foreign policy. Yet in the face of inequality, members of marginalized communities are tackling challenges in their communities and global threats to peace and prosperity. Communities are waiting for us to see them, engage them, listen to them, and amplify their voices. When we work together to mitigate inequity, discrimination, and violence targeting members of marginalized communities and invest in advancing human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, societies as a whole will prosper and our work to advance U.S. national security priorities through foreign affairs will have lasting impact. </p></article>

<p>Treasury has established the Equity Hub within the Office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility to lead research and policy analysis that supports the Department in its effort to drive toward a more fair and equitable economy. In recognition of the sovereignty of, and our partnership with, Tribal Nations, Treasury's Office of Tribal and Native Affairs is responsible for advising on departmental issues related to Tribal governments and Native communities, including the administration of $ 30 billion in direct Tribal set - asides to the benefit of over 2.5 million Tribal citizens. The Office also conducts consultations with Tribes and coordinates outreach. As of June 2023, the Office has hosted over 45 formal consultations and 700 Tribal engagement sessions. Treasury has made significant efforts to engage with stakeholders and the public on topics related to equity. For instance, in December 2022, the Department held the first TACRE meeting, with subsequent meetings in March, June, and September 2023. Since their first convening, the Committee established cross - cutting principles and priorities and has submitted 13 recommendations to Treasury. Recommendations are currently under review and address issues such as data transparency, taxpayer access to Direct File, direct engagement with taxpayers who could benefit from tax credits and working with CDFIs to promote diversification through the certification and re - certification processes. The Department collaborated with 12 national Hispanic and Latino organizations to host the first Treasury Department summit on investing in the economic future of the Latino community in June 2023 to elevate challenges and opportunities facing that community. The Latino Economic Summit brought together nearly 100 leaders from the private, non - profit, and government sectors to identify opportunities to unleash the potential of the Latino community and the entire economy. Treasury's Office of Civil Rights and Equal Employment Opportunity (OCRE) continues to work with the White House to encourage the appointment of Latino staff and continues working with community lenders to unlock potential that had previously been sidelined. The result will be economic growth within the Latino community, as well as shared prosperity for everyone. Treasury launched a blog series detailing the origins of racial economic disparities and the implications for the national economy. OCRE has made significant efforts to increase civil rights <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">compliance</span> and equal opportunity throughout the Department with the implementation of a new external civil rights language access plan and complaint tracking system.

<p>Under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 and the <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="American Rescue Plan">American Rescue Plan</span> Act of 2021, Treasury supported the economic recovery for communities and individuals impacted by COVID - 19 through the ARP. For example, the Department and the CDFI Fund have deployed historic amounts of capital to CDFIs and MDIs - institutions that have a demonstrated track record of reaching financially underserved borrowers. In addition, through the ECIP, Treasury has made close to $ 8.4 billion in investments in 170 community financial institutions, in addition to over $ 1.73 billion in grants through the CDFI ERP, and a historic $ 226 million investment in 68 Puerto Rican cooperativas, or cooperative community financial institutions. New ECIP reporting data made available in October 2023, reflecting lending in the final six months of 2022, showed that ECIP lenders originated a total of approximately $ 26 billion in loans, of which approximately 75 % went to low - and moderate - income borrowers, borrowers in rural communities and other categories of qualified lending. Approximately one third of their total originations, $ 8.6 billion, were " " deep impact " " loans, made to the hardest - to - serve borrowers, including those that are low - income, residents on Tribal lands and in US Territories and owners of very small businesses. Treasury leveraged the ERA program to create the first - ever nationwide infrastructure to prevent eviction, with more than 12.3 million household payments to families at risk of eviction as of June 30, 2023. This program has been particularly effective at reaching low - income and / or traditionally underserved renters, including Black and women - headed households. By reimagining how the IRS serves families, the IRS delivered half of the expanded Child Tax Credit (CTC) via monthly payments from July to December 2021. Treasury also collaborated with Code for America, a non - governmental non - profit, to build a streamlined, mobile - friendly portal in English and Spanish to make it easier for families to access the expanded CTC. New Census data released in 2022 showed that the expanded CTC was the leading driver behind a 46 percent decline in child poverty in 2021 - cutting the annual child poverty rate to its lowest - ever recorded level including record lows in Black, Hispanic, Native American, Asian, and white child poverty. Additionally, the permanent lifting of restrictions that prevented some Puerto Rican families from receiving the CTC led to 200,000 more Puerto Rican families receiving the credit when they filed taxes in 2022 compared to the year prior. As of September 2023, Treasury has approved 54 out of 56 state and territory applications for SSBCI Capital Programs totaling over $ 8.2 billion in allocations, and has announced approvals of up to $ 73 million corresponding to applications representing 39 Tribes.

Scale up implementation of Inclusive Development Assessments (IDAs). An IDA is an assessment tool that guides in - country interviews and research to help identify in a particular country those populations that are marginalized and excluded from access to public services such as health, education, transportation, and or economic opportunities. Through the IDA we are able to analyze the country's social, economic, political, and cultural factors that lead to marginalization, determine access to assets, resources, opportunities, and services. IDA concludes with a summary of the context and provides specific recommendations for USAID to increase inclusion of marginalized groups in their development programmes and policies. Analyze up to 10 Performance Plan and Report (PPR) Key Issue Narratives and identify new opportunities for advancing racial and ethnic equity and support for underserved communities in programming. Establish targets for increased budgetary attributions during the Operational Plan process against all of the following Key Issues: Racial and Ethnic Equity, Indigenous Peoples, LGBTQI +, and Disability. Develop and expand training and technical assistance to build staff capacity to advance racial and ethnic equity and other knowledge gaps. In collaboration with FSC Indigenous Foundation (FSCIF), Alianza Mesoamericana de Pueblos Bosques (AMPB) and Asociación de Mujeres Artesanas de Ipeti Embera (AMARIE) USAID will complete a pilot intervention that promotes cultural rights, preservation of Indigenous language, and the development of ancestral knowledge as part of the intangible cultural heritage of the Indigenous Peoples. Strengthen USAID's ability to incorporate local and Indigenous knowledge, particularly from racial and ethnic underserved communities, into evidence collection and use. A new four - year, $ 5.1 million Local Evaluation and Evidence Support mechanism will provide technical and advisory services to strengthen the organizational and evaluation capacity of local evaluation and research organizations, starting with selected countries in Africa. Through this process, local and indigenous knowledge will be incorporated into evaluations. Provide technical assistance and co - funding to establish seven Indigenous Peoples Advisors at Missions. </p></article>

<p>The Agency identified and created a cadre of training, tools, and resources to streamline proposal and evaluation processes. M Bureau provides staff a platform to share innovative practices and systems to streamline procurement processes through the A & A Innovation Community of Practice. USAID updated its Youth Policy and released the new Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment Policy in March 2023. USAID released its new LGBTQI + Inclusive Development Policy in August 2023 and Strategic Religious Engagement Policy in September 2023. These policies reiterate the importance of and clarify approaches to inclusion and equity in USAID's programs, for USAID staff and stakeholders. USAID recently announced the launch of the Racial and Ethnic Equity Initiative, and teams are conducting assessments and collecting data from USAID Missions overseas to build a knowledge base of operational practices and best practices that have successfully advanced social inclusion and racial equity in foreign assistance programming. Exposure to these best practices and technical <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">guidance</span> will encourage the adoption of quality equity programs on a broader scale. USAID Missions and Bureaus are now required to report on a new key issue narrative in their annual reports capturing racial and ethnic equity. They also must annually report on the percentage of completed evaluations with at least one local expert on the evaluation team. USAID released the Agency's highest level policy document, the Policy Framework, in March 2023. The Policy Framework emphasizes a commitment to embed DEIA principles across our programs, people, processes, policies, and practices so that development gains are more locally - led and benefit people of all backgrounds and identities. b) Environmental Justice Scorecard (pursuant to section 223 of EO 14008) USAID is not required to complete the Environmental Justice Scorecard. USAID promotes environmental equity and monitors progress through the Global Action for Climate Equity. c) Additional Efforts to Advance Equity Fourteen country - level Inclusive Development Assessments (IDAs), which aim to map the context and needs of marginalized groups through an intersectional lens to improve equity in programming, have been performed across the Agency. The ID Hub's Inclusive Development Activity for Mission Support (IDAMS) has begun work on three additional IDAs and is poised to to scale up these activities in FY 2024. The Office of Civil Rights established the External Civil Rights Division covering Title VI and other relevant civil rights authorities to ensure USAID complies with Title VI requirements under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Division receives and addresses complaints of discrimination in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance The External Civil Rights Division's internal website launched in June 2023, which educates USAID staff on the Title VI legal requirements and <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">statutes</span> and how they apply to USAID programs and partners.

<p>US Small Businesses: To enhance the consideration given to small business concerns within the Agency's policy framework, it is crucial to also recognize the distinct challenges Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs) face in the federal contracting process.

USAID has made progress expanding direct funding to local partners; in FY 2022, over 10 percent of the Agency's acquisitions and assistance funding was channeled directly through local partners, the highest percentage in at least a decade, up from 7 percent in FY 2021 and an average of 5 percent between FY 2012 through FY 2020. But with an Agency wide target of 25 percent direct local funding, expanded efforts to tackle barriers to partnership are required.

Most Missions do not have dedicated advisors for the full inclusive development portfolio, which entails having technical knowledge and expertise related to the challenges and barriers faced by numerous marginalized groups in the local context. In addition, a recent staffing survey identified gaps in the number of Gender Advisors at Missions and their level of effort dedicated to this role. Many Missions do not yet meet the new Gender Advisor level of effort requirement included in the 2023 Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment Policy; they have three years to address this gap. Some Mission Gender Advisors are focused solely on gender equality issues, some on gender equality and inclusive development issues, and some gender advisors also cover other areas such as Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) or serve as technical office's AOR / CORs. When additional functions like MEL are added to the Gender Advisors role, they report too broad a workload, which may limit their ability to effectively incorporate gender equality and inclusive development in programming. </p></article>

<p>Barriers to Equity: The unique legal status of tribes, tribal jurisdiction, and tribal land holdings has significantly hindered access to USDA programs for tribes and Native Americans. For example: Tribal corporations are currently ineligible for RD programs. Many indigenous plants and animals are excluded from FNS federal nutrition programs and AMS procurement opportunities. And tribal commercial activity is deemed disqualifying for some RD programs, even though - because they lack a robust tax base - tribal nations often systematically participate in commercial markets to accrue revenue necessary to provide their nation, and often neighboring communities, with (public) goods and services. These kinds of barriers, sometimes the results of <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">legislation</span> and other times caused by poorly drafted departmental documents, have obstructed Indian Country access to USDA programs, in turn complicating economic development and tribal self - determination. </p></article>

While rulemaking is still ongoing, VA highlights the following public - facing efforts to hear concerns from underrepresented groups: July 2020: Published a proposed rule in the Federal Register to amend 38 C.F.R. § 3.12 (85 FR 41471) Update and Clarify <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">Regulatory</span> Bars to Benefits Based on Character of Discharge; September 2021: Published a Request for Information (RFI) to the Federal Register for additional public commentary on aspects of the proposed <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Regulatory">regulation</span> (86 FR 50513) Discharge; and Held listening sessions in October 2021. VA published a request for information (RFI) on June 20, 2023, for the public to provide data and information on minority and historically underserved Veterans. Historically underserved Veterans includes racial and ethnic minorities (Asian American; Black or African American; Hispanic / Latino; Native American, including American Indian, Alaskan Native and Native Hawaiian; or Pacific - Islander American); LGBTQ + individuals; those determined to be underserved based on their religious beliefs and practices; those with language barriers or without citizenship status; and those in rural areas and on tribal lands.
