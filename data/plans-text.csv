At its core, equity calls for the government to treat all individuals in a fair, just, and impartial manner-with the recognition that many communities have often been denied such treatment in the past, resulting in disparities today. To underscore the priority I place on this work and secure commitments to advance equity in the Department's programs and activities, in March 2021 I convened the DHS Equity Task Force, headed by the Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, including members from all the Department's operational agencies and Headquarters offices.",Text,Text 2,2,2,3

For example, in furtherance of EO 13988, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) issued updated policy guidance removing the requirement that people requesting immigration benefits submit proof of their gender identity when seeking to change their gender marker, thereby allowing individuals requesting benefits to choose their self-identified gender marker, regardless of the marker displayed on supporting documentation. Pursuant to EO 14008, DHS continued implementing the Civil Rights Evaluation Tool, a data collection and technical assistance tool that helps conduct and advance civil rights compliance evaluations of federally assisted recipients, including environmental justice concerns and civil rights policies and procedures for public-facing programs and activities that have human health or environmental impacts.

Our belief as stated in our FY 2022 Equity Action Plan remains true today: communities with environmental justice concerns and other overburdened communities are often deeply affected by environmental policymaking. Yet these communities with environmental justice concerns can face multiple resource and capacity challenges to engaging with EPA or accessing its programs and resources. These communities often have experienced decades of chronic underinvestment and frequently lack capacity to engage in decision-making processes, prepare competitive proposals, or manage federal awards. EPA and other federal partners may fail to coordinate funding and assistance programs, thereby transferring the burden of identifying and coordinating complementary programs onto the already capacity-constrained community. These barriers most affect communities that are smaller; have faced decades of disinvestment and overburden; are economically or otherwise disadvantaged; have limited English proficiency or populations with disabilities that prevent full access to meetings and information; and/or lack access to digital infrastructure.",Text,Text 127,12,13,2832

Additionally, digital services very often fail to prioritize human-centered design and usability beyond compliance. This means that Americans who likely have a critical need to connect with government information and services through digital platforms also are likely to have the hardest time doing SO. Examples include both lack of access to the newest hardware or good internet, which often means newer digital platforms do not perform as well (because they are not built for older devices or don't work with low bandwidth connections), or software that is not designed to work across all populations, such as lack of plain language impacting populations with limited English proficiency or poorly trained Al models causing biometric systems to perform worse for people with different ages or skin tones. GSA - through its consulting and fellowships offerings such as the Centers of Excellence and the Presidential Innovation Fellows, shared services such as Login.gov and the US Web Design System, and Federal partners in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and United States Digital Service - plays a central role in the responsible development, deployment, and procurement of technologies used by the Federal Government to communicate or interact with the public. 4 GSA is committed to delivering high-impact digital services and products in a manner that improves customer experience, reduces burden, broadens access, and advances civic tech practices that are intrinsically equity-aware and community-informed.",Text,Text 84,13,6,3285

This convenient option allows parents to obtain an SSN without having to visit a local Social Security field office or Card Center. However, unlike the standard SSN application, the current EAB process does not collect voluntarily race and ethnicity data. Today, almost all new SSNs are processed through EAB. In FY 2022, EAB accounted for 99 percent of SSNs issued for children under the age of one.

On day one of the Biden-Harris Administration, President Biden issued Executive Order 13985, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government. The Executive Order recognized that although equal opportunity is a bedrock ideal of American democracy, it is too often thwarted by entrenched disparities in our laws, public policies, and institutional structures and processes.

President Biden has emphasized that equity is a generational commitment, not a one-year project. I emphatically agree. Success depends on the institutionalization this year's plan reflects. At USDA, we have embedded equity in the work we do across the Department, and we are moving forward together, based on the insight that our country is stronger when everyone has a seat at the table and everyone has food on their plate.

Also, VA's mission and statutory mandate require VA to be Veterans First in all efforts surrounding procurement. The Veterans First statutory mandate is implemented through the VA Rule of Two. The statute requires the Department to set-aside contracts first for Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) and Veteran-owned Small Businesses (VOSB) before other socio-economic categories, after it is determined that the Veteran firm can meet all other required acquisition regulatory and legislative criteria. Thus, by law, WOSB, HUBZone and SDB companies not owned by Veterans are considered only after a determination is made that an SDVOSB or VOSB set-aside is unfeasible.

In FY 2022, out of $6.3 billion in contract dollars awarded through some type of set-aside, VA awarded $5.7 billion (91%) specifically using the SDVOSB set-aside. Since the SDVOSB set-aside is first on VA's procurement hierarchy, this result is predictable. However, the second tier on VA's procurement hierarchy (VOSB set-aside) was used to award only $59 million, a dramatically lower figure. Awards through the HUBZone and 8(a) Business Development Program set asides were even lower. Alternatively, the last tier on VA's set-aside hierarchy received the second highest volume of dollars; $461 million were awarded through the general small business set-aside. These data illustrate two factors. First, the procurement hierarchy tends to screen out contracting opportunities for programs lower on the hierarchy.
