<p>In May 2023, the FEMA Floodplain Management Division published the FY 2023 Community Assistance Program - State Support Services Element (CAP - SSSE) Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO). The CAP - SSSE program provides funding to states to deliver technical assistance to communities in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), and to <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="accountability">evaluate</span> community performance in implementing NFIP floodplain management activities. The NOFO requires states to consider equity in program delivery and assist vulnerable populations disproportionately impacted by disasters. Furthermore, the CAP - SSSE Tiered State Framework includes several characteristics used to summarize the strength of a state's NFIP Coordinating Agency program. One characteristic is " " Addressing Equity in Floodplain Management, " " which considers how states plan, prioritize, and track floodplain management activities for underserved communities and populations. </p></article>

<p>In March 2023, DHS published the Privacy Impact Assessment for ICE alternatives to detention programs, including an Appendix that addresses the Case Management Pilot Program (CMPP). CMPP leads to more <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 139, 0.3)" title="Teams">equitable outcomes</span> for program participants, many of whom are racial minorities, by providing services that include, but are not limited to, mental health services, trafficking screening, legal orientation programs, cultural orientation programs, connections to social services, and departure planning and reintegration services for individuals returning to their home countries. The Privacy Impact Assessment describes the application of privacy mitigation measures to the CMPP, including the limits of data sharing between CRCL and ICE regarding program participants. CMPP enrollments in Houston began in April 2023 and enrollments in New York began in May 2023. As of November 2023, there are 248 enrolled participants. Enrollments will continue throughout the year. CMPP plans to add more service providers later in calendar year 2023 via FY 2022 appropriated funds of $ 15 million that were awarded as a grant to the CMPP National Board in July 2023. The National Board began the solicitation process in July 2023 to award those funds to service providers. </p></article>

Stakeholders also recommended enhancing community <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 185, 0.3)" title="community engagement">engagement</span> on the use and application of AI going forward to build greater trust with communities. <span style="background-color: rgba(232, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Staff Experience">Staff</span> consultation with the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, policy development <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 185, 0.3)" title="community engagement">engagement</span> dating back to the 2014 - 15 White House Big Data Papers, literature study, and interagency <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 185, 0.3)" title="community engagement">engagement</span> with colleagues who have faced similar challenges and developed ethical codes and best practices in response, provide a basis for anticipating the challenges to ensuring compliance with applicable law and policy and in using AI to advance equity across all DHS missions. To encourage <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="accountability">accountability</span> and responsible use of AI in government programs and processes, the U.S. Government <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="accountability">Accountability</span> Office (GAO) developed an AI <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="accountability">accountability</span> framework ensuring AI is responsible, equitable, traceable, reliable, and governable. According to NIST, how accurately face recognition software tools identify people of varied sex, age, and racial backgrounds depends in part on the algorithm and data used. Results captured in the NIST report, Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT) Part 3: Demographic Effects (NISTIR 8280), found empirical evidence for the existence of demographic differentials across algorithms and developers, with the most accurate algorithms producing many fewer errors; NIST expects those algorithms to have smaller demographic differentials. A key goal of the Department's use of facial recognition technology is identifying and eliminating, to the extent it exists, any improper bias. The Final Report of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (2021) determined that " " unintended bias can be introduced during many stages of the machine learning (ML) process, which can lead to disparate impacts in American society, a problem that has been documented in law enforcement contexts. " " Commission recommendations include the establishment of " " a task force to assess the privacy and civil liberties implications of AI and emerging technologies " " and " " empower DHS Offices of Privacy and Civil Rights and Civil Liberties [ to ] play an integral role in the legal and approval processes for the procurement and use of Al - enabled systems.

To address these <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 139, 0, 0.3)" title="barriers">barriers</span>, DHS will conduct a review of contract opportunities and grant funding opportunity announcements prior to release to determine how equitable access for tribes can be furthered; examine policy and procedures to identify updates in furtherance of security and the appropriate handling of sacred, ceremonial, or cultural items and conduct training on the same; pursue adequate <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 139, 0.3)" title="Teams">staffing</span> and other resources where needed to ensure equitable service delivery; ensure Tribal representation in DHS advisory councils, committees, and other groups; and pursue modifications to service delivery, including where legislative fixes are needed.

To address <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 139, 0, 0.3)" title="barriers">barriers</span> and suggested changes raised by stakeholders, FEMA will publish an Interim Final Rule (IFR) amending its regulations governing the IA program to increase equity by simplifying processes, removing <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 139, 0, 0.3)" title="barriers">barriers</span> to entry, and increasing eligibility for certain types of assistance under the program. (9) Advance equity through Community Disaster Resilience Zones. FEMA's National Advisory Council has found that smaller, less affluent communities with fewer resources cannot access funding to appropriately prepare for a disaster, which leads to inadequate response and recovery and little opportunity for mitigation. To address this <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 139, 0, 0.3)" title="barriers">barrier</span>, FEMA will enhance and expand Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) Program technical assistance; implement Benefit - Cost Analysis (BCA) enhancements for all relevant mitigation programs, including incorporating equity weights into BCA; and develop a Recovery and Resilience Resource Portal, which provides ideas and information on available funding opportunities for state, local, Tribal, and territorial (SLTT) partners and community decision - makers. </p></article>

<p>1. Applying for Naturalization. USCIS began a comprehensive review of policies, regulations, forms, and operations to identify <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 139, 0, 0.3)" title="barriers">barriers</span> that may impede access to naturalization by underserved communities and is undertaking efforts to reduce or eliminate those <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 139, 0, 0.3)" title="barriers">barriers</span>. In October 2022, USCIS updated Form N - 648 (Medical Certification for Disability Exceptions) and related Policy Manual guidance. Applicants for naturalization with physical or developmental disability or mental impairments may request an exception to the English and civics testing requirements for naturalization. This form and Policy Manual update <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 185, 255, 0.3)" title="Customer Service">streamline</span> the process for applicants to claim and substantiate a disability by eliminating unnecessary and duplicative questions. In March 2023, USCIS updated Policy Manual guidance to allow individuals requesting immigration benefits to self - select their gender marker (" " Male " " or " " Female " ") without the need to provide proof of their gender identity or to match the gender listed on their supporting documentation. This update reflects an important step toward reducing administrative burdens on applicants and increasing accessibility to immigration benefits and services. 2. Accessing Humanitarian Protection During Immigration Processing. DHS improved access to humanitarian protection during immigration processing by addressing <span style="background-color: rgba(93, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="language accessibility">language</span> and disability access gaps and enhancing access to legal information and resources. In July 2022, USCIS issued new <span style="background-color: rgba(93, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="language accessibility">language</span> access guidance to ensure that LEP individuals seeking asylum who cannot be interviewed in the credible fear screening process are placed into removal proceedings where an immigration judge can apply appropriate <span style="background-color: rgba(93, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="language accessibility">language</span> access safeguards as that individual seeks relief.

<p>Tribal Nations tend to be located in very rural areas with varying degrees of capacity and infrastructure. For many Tribal Nations, even access to internet, phones, and utilities is a challenge, underscoring the depth of the digital divide and resulting in limited access to government services and information. During consultations, Tribal Nations have reported equity concerns about inaccessibility and unfairness of contract and grant opportunities, screening and handling of sacred items, a lack of DHS <span style="background-color: rgba(232, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Staff Experience">staff</span> and other resources dedicated to fulfilling DHS responsibilities to the Nations, a lack of representation on some advisory councils and committees, and uncertainty that DHS would pursue modifications to unfair practices that might require legislative fixes. </p></article>

<p>Benefit applicants, both overseas and domestic, sometimes have difficulty attending USCIS appointments when the distance needed to travel is long. There are <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 139, 0, 0.3)" title="barriers">barriers</span> related to transportation, health and safety, and finances. In FY 2023, USCIS's Refugee, Asylum, and International Operations (RAIO) began increasing the use of video technology to conduct I - 589 asylum interviews domestically, and I - 590 refugee interviews internationally, SO that applicants living in remote locations will not have to wait SO long or travel SO far. USCIS is currently drafting a proposed rule that would codify RAIO's flexibility to conduct remote interviews with refugee applicants abroad. In March 2023, USCIS published an extension to the Asylum Interpreter Temporary Final Rule (TFR) that allowed USCIS to provide telephonic interpreters for asylum applicants who speak one of 47 listed languages through September 12, 2023. Telephonic interpreters can also be connected to video interviews SO that remote interviews can be completed. The TFR temporarily reduced <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 139, 0, 0.3)" title="barriers">barriers</span> for asylum applicants to attend and complete their interviews. There is a significant backlog of pending petitions for U nonimmigrant status due, in part, to the annual statutory cap limiting approvals to 10,000 principal petitions per fiscal year. As this backlog of over 250,000 filings are solely filed via paper and postal mail, USCIS is considering ways to leverage technology to improve processing to provide Employment Authorization Documents and deferred action for U petitioners and their derivatives with pending filings. As noted in the U.S. National Plan to End Gender - Based Violence, immigrant survivors face increased <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 139, 0, 0.3)" title="barriers">barriers</span> to economic stability. They often encounter delayed processing times when applying for special immigration remedies for GBV victims that were established through VAWA and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, such as the VAWA self - petition, the U nonimmigrant status for eligible victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and qualifying eligible crimes, and the T nonimmigrant status for eligible victims of a severe form of trafficking in persons. Delays in access to work authorization and public benefits for which an individual is potentially eligible, such as housing assistance or health care, can increase vulnerabilities to abuse and undermine recovery and healing. For refugees living in many parts of the world to access the US Refugee Admissions Program, they need to be interviewed and processed by USCIS while they are overseas, which presents many logistical and travel challenges for both the refugees and USCIS <span style="background-color: rgba(232, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Staff Experience">staff</span>. When USCIS has no permanent presence in a geographic area, processing occurs when USCIS has the <span style="background-color: rgba(232, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Staff Experience">staff</span> to make several international trips to complete different processing steps, thereby increasing the processing time. There are numerous steps involved in processing benefits for refugee populations, such as medical exams, refugee interviews, finalization of the decision, and assurances for placement with domestic resettlement agencies. These steps typically take place sequentially and may take a long time in between steps. Noncitizen workers are particularly vulnerable to workplace abuses including unpaid wages, discrimination, health and safety violations, and reprisals for seeking to improve working conditions. In addition, noncitizen workers are often afraid to report violations to labor enforcement agencies or participate in labor standards investigations for fear of immigration - related retaliation or threats of deportation by their employers. </p></article>

<p>In May 2022, CBP implemented an online training course titled " " Disability Access Training for Law Enforcement Professionals " " to educate uniformed officers and agents about their roles and responsibilities for ensuring nondiscrimination in CBP - conducted services, programs, and activities for members of the public with disabilities. CBP's uniformed officers and agents will be required to complete the training on a biennial basis. In January 2023, DHS announced a <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 185, 255, 0.3)" title="Customer Service">streamlined</span> process for noncitizens in labor agency investigations to request deferred action consistent with Policy Statement 065 - 06, Worksite Enforcement: The Strategy to Protect the American Labor Market, the Conditions of the American Worksite, and the Dignity of the Individual. Deferred action protects noncitizen workers from threats of immigration - related retaliation from exploitative employers. These improvements advance the Biden - Harris Administration's commitment to empowering workers and improving workplace conditions by enabling all workers, including noncitizens, to assert their legal rights. 3. Bidding on a DHS Contract. DHS strengthened efforts to engage small businesses, including those owned by members of underserved communities such as women, minorities, and individuals with disabilities, through various outreach activities. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2022, DHS exceeded all small business prime and socioeconomic goals as negotiated with the Small Business Administration, equating to $ 9 billion awarded to small businesses, including $ 4 billion to small, disadvantaged businesses. DHS is the largest spending agency to have this level of goal achievement. In FY 2022, the DHS Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) launched Small - to - Small Business Vendor Outreach Matchmaking Events (VOMEs), facilitating business - to - business meetings to encourage new entrants, explore subcontracting and teaming opportunities, and assist with decreasing gaps in small business capabilities. The VOME is another federal best practice and a first for federal OSDBU offices. Three VOMEs were held in FY 2022, garnering 1,100 registrants and nearly 800 meetings. Three VOMEs were also held in FY 2023, resulting in over 1,500 small business registrations and over 500 meetings. In FY 2023, OSDBU has hosted 10 Vendor Outreach Sessions to include four specifically reserved for underserved groups (e.g., service - disabled veteran - owned, women - owned, and HUBZone firms). 4.

Strengthen resources for non - detained noncitizens released on an alternative to detention by building on existing case management programs, like the Case Management Pilot Program, which provides case management, legal information and screening, trafficking screening, and connection to a range of social services, including pro se counsel, to noncitizens on ATD. As enumerated in DHS's National Action Plan to implement the Gender Policy Council Strategy, USCIS and ICE will work to expand access to T and U nonimmigrant statuses and VAWA protections. These benefits offer critical protection for many of our most vulnerable noncitizens - those who have been victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons and other specified crimes, and those who are victims of battery or extreme cruelty by an abusive spouse or other family member. All three benefits are crucial in stabilizing victims by providing a potential pathway to lawful permanent residence. The Department will explore how to prevent instances of domestic abuse, gender - based violence, human trafficking, and other criminal activity by raising awareness of and expanding access to potentially eligible noncitizens, including women of color, who may be particularly vulnerable. USCIS leads this effort and has set goals to guide its backlog - reduction efforts.

<p>The DHS Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships (CP3) conducted targeted outreach to additional local and underserved communities, providing technical assistance and support to those stakeholders. The Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention (TVTP) Grant Program provides funding for state, local, Tribal, and territorial governments, nonprofits, and institutions of higher education to establish or enhance capabilities to prevent targeted violence and terrorism. In FY 2022, CP3 reached 49 new organizations and over 900 people, resulting in 31 applications from, and 11 awards to, organizations representing underserved communities. In response to a wave of bomb threats targeting Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in 2022, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Office for Bombing Prevention (OBP) conducted 27 courses for HBCU students and faculty in prevention and building resilience, trained more than 1,200 participants, delivered over 1,500 products, and saw a 54 percent increase in the more than 24,000 training video completions. Additional courses are ongoing. In 2022, CRCL, the DHS Office of State and Local Law Enforcement (OSLLE), and the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity through HBCUs, sponsored full - day courses at five HBCUs to help equip campus leaders and other community stakeholders with the problem - solving skills to prevent, protect, and mitigate the effects of, respond to, and recover from active shooter situations. Since July 2022, DHS has led multiple engagements focused on addressing community concerns related to DVE, Department strategy, and incidents of hate targeting specific communities.

<p>6. Airport Screening. In furtherance of TSA's mission to protect the Nation's transportation systems and facilitate lawful travel, TSA has enhanced and standardized training for its screening officers and has improved its screening technology capabilities to reduce the possibility of bias against travelers and increase safety. TSA deployed new Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) software for screening systems at airports across the country. This update eliminates the need for Transportation Security Officers to determine a passenger's gender prior to AIT screening and is projected to reduce the instances of enhanced screening for transgender persons and members of other underserved communities. TSA has held multiple community engagements to enhance communication with the traveling public and increase awareness of security procedures. 7. Trusted Traveler Programs. DHS has taken steps to advance equity in its Trusted Traveler Programs. TSA updated the PreCheck application process by allowing individuals to select their gender marker based on self - attestation, regardless of sex assigned at birth. The application was updated to include additional gender marker options to better serve non - binary and gender non - conforming travelers. 8. Public Assistance. FEMA has advanced equity as a foundation for public assistance. In August 2022, FEMA's Office for Public Assistance released the Operational Draft of the Public Assistance Program Delivery Guide, which included considerations for FEMA recipients and applicants to conduct response and recovery efforts in an equitable manner. The Guide includes a performance metric for the prioritization of communities rated as highly socially vulnerable, including underserved rural areas. From April 2021 through August 2022, FEMA's Office for Equal Rights worked with the Office for Public Assistance on its mission to ensure an equitable response to the COVID - 19 pandemic. FEMA established the Civil Rights Advisory Group as part of the agency's commitment to the COVID - 19 vaccination mission amid the ongoing battle against the pandemic. The advisory group's mission is to <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="accountability">evaluate</span> the policies, practices, strategies, and plans in place to ensure equity in vaccine access and administration. 9.

FEMA continues to advance <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 139, 0.3)" title="Teams">equitable outcomes</span> for disaster survivors. FEMA is working to identify and include considerations for traditionally underserved or marginalized communities in the forms, processes, and online Grants Portal system that the agency uses to support applicants. </p></article>

<p>FEMA is redeveloping the way it collects, documents, and processes information from applicants to be less burdensome, more effective, and more equitable in the distribution of Public Assistance. Moving forward, FEMA will work to clarify the recipient's legal responsibility and to structure a more comprehensive reporting process SO that recipients and subrecipients clearly understand their obligations to develop and report on their strategies for equitable response and recovery. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) selected Recovering from a Disaster as a Life Experience Project in 2022. Discovery work was completed to inform how FEMA could create an equitable and less frustrating experience to survivors while they are enduring trauma. Based on recommendations made from the discovery work, the General Services Administration is currently partnering with FEMA to measure end - to - end burden placed on natural disaster survivors. 10. Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP). NSGP provides funding for physical security enhancements to nonprofit organizations, including houses of worship, that are at high risk of terrorist attack. FEMA has improved equitable access to NSGP funding by improving <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 185, 0.3)" title="community engagement">participation</span> from nonprofit organizations serving underserved communities and embedding equity considerations in the grant review process. FEMA continues to engage in robust outreach and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 185, 0.3)" title="community engagement">engagement</span> efforts throughout the NSGP lifecycle to ensure that nonprofit organizations have the information they need to apply. In FY 2022, NSGP held 82 events, including webinars, with over 18,039 unique participants to increase understanding of the application process and eligibility for subrecipients. In June 2023, FEMA published an informative video about applying to the NSGP, available both on YouTube.com and FEMA.gov. FEMA has collaborated with other federal and nonprofit partners to further amplify this <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 185, 0.3)" title="community engagement">engagement</span> and messaging, including the DHS Center for Faith - Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, Department of Justice (DOJ) Community Relations Service, religious and cultural organizations, HBCUs, and Minority Serving Institutions. In FY 2023, FEMA advanced considerations of equity in awarding NSGP grant funding by adding up to 15 additional points to the scores of organizations that demonstrate how they serve an underserved community or population or that are located within an underserved community. Additionally, applicants who had never received NSGP funding had 15 points added to their project score (a scoring metric continued from FY 2022). </p></article>

<p>Illinois: $ 23 million federal cost share with Village of DePue Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) Rebuild. After heavy rain in 2008, several neighborhood roads in the Village of DePue, an Economically Disadvantaged Rural Community, were flooded. The increased flow at the WWTP caused raw sewage to back up into the basements of homes. Through BRIC DTA, DePue will build a new WWTP on village property outside of the floodway and floodplain. The old plant will be demolished and left as open space. Arkansas: $ 2.51 million federal cost share with Danville School District Safe Room.

On September 19, 2023, EDA announced a total of $ 4.5 million in grants to 11 organizations that are creating and implementing STEM talent development strategies that complement their region's innovation economy. Million Women in Construction Initiative. The Department of Labor's (Labor) Employment and Earnings by Occupation data showed that the number of women working in the construction industry at only 10 percent or 1.2 million women as of 2020. Secretary Raimondo announced a public goal to double the number of women working in the construction industry over the next ten years. To achieve this goal, the Department is promoting the goal through large implementation programs, <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 46, 0.3)" title="collaboration">working with</span> other agencies to do the same, and highlighting commitments from Labor and the private sector to launch complementary efforts. In July 2023, the Secretary hired a Senior Advisor for Women in Construction to oversee this initiative. Through the Internet for All program, Commerce will promote increased outreach to recruit women in broadband construction. NTIA's BEAD program requires states and territories to develop workforce plans that include strategies to ensure the job opportunities created will be available to a diverse pool of workers, including women and people of color. Through the CHIPS NOFO for commercial facilities, applicants are asked to describe how they will recruit, hire, and retain a diverse and skilled construction workforce, including efforts to include women and other economically disadvantaged individuals in the construction industry. Additionally, the CHIPS NOFO for commercial fabrication facilities requires applicants requesting over $ 150 million in direct funding to provide a plan for access to child care for facility and construction workers. This will expand access to training opportunities and enable workers to fully participate in these high - quality, good - paying jobs. </p></article>

<p>The most persistent <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 139, 0, 0.3)" title="barriers">barrier</span> to the establishment, expansion, and growth of minority business enterprises (MBEs) continues to be access to capital. The U.S. Federal Reserve found that more than half of Black - owned businesses were turned down for private bank loans, a rate twice as high as white business owners. A Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies study found that 6 in 10 Black business owners faced challenges obtaining capital. Over a third of Latino business owners faced the same. Business owners of color were more likely to struggle to access startup funding, growth funding, and capital with affordable interest rates. In 2022, in the U.S., only 1.9 percent of venture capital dollars went to all - women teams; less than. 5 percent went to Black and Brown women; only 12 percent of venture capital decision - makers are women. Innovation fueled economic growth in America for the past century, but since the 1970s, innovation (as measured by fundamental productivity growth) appears to have slowed from an annual increase of 1.9 percent to 0.7 percent. Research shows that innovation in the U.S. could quadruple if women, minorities, and children from low - income families became inventors at the same rate as men from high - income families. According to the USPTO, that increase in inventorship would grow our economy and GDP by an estimated $ 1 trillion. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, fewer than 1 percent of minority - owned businesses export goods or services. For these enterprises, insufficient financial resources often hinder their ability to invest in overseas market exploration, navigate regulatory complexities, and establish international networks. </p></article>

<p>DoD operational and training activities during the World War II and Cold War eras resulted in adverse environmental, health, and economic impacts to communities, including American Indian and Alaska Native communities. Historically, DoD built temporary bases and bombing ranges on and near Indian lands, Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act - conveyed properties, ancestral lands, and reserved treaty rights areas. Legacy impacts from operations at these former bases and ranges may include hazardous materials, debris, underground fuel storage tanks, lead - based paint, asbestos, munitions / explosives residue, and abandoned or unsafe sites. These impacts create a <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 139, 0, 0.3)" title="barriers">barrier</span> to Indigenous populations by potentially hindering land development for housing, economic opportunities (e.g., harvesting timber), or protecting the land for subsistence food gathering or cultural practices. Current training and operational activities, although now conducted in a manner to reduce adverse impacts, still can be <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 139, 0, 0.3)" title="barriers">barriers</span> to equity. More recently, DoD's efforts to expand its footprint on Guam may result in additional stress on the infrastructure of the island and the local population. Much of this stress will impact underserved communities. Finally, the construction of a new installation in Guam coupled with the surge in military construction projects at legacy installations has increased the quantity of unearthed artifacts. The only certified repository on Guam is very small and is operated by the NPS to curate the NPS's War in the Pacific collection. </p></article>

<p>Global insecurity affects the national security of the United States, as regions of conflict often provide havens for terrorists and other illicit actors; become proxies for strategic competition; and lead to population displacement, migration, and further regional instability. Women, girls, and other underserved communities are disproportionally impacted by conflict and instability, which often exacerbate gender - based violence.

Despite the critical role women can play in their defense institutions, women's recruitment, career progressions, and involvement in security sector decision making still lags behind globally due to gender - based <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 139, 0, 0.3)" title="barriers">barriers</span> https: / / us - east - 1 - 02900067 - inspect.menlosecurity.com / safeview - fileserv / tc download / 7267d6ebc83f7eef415b6f13509bd4b3f2e259555850b7d4eb9de12 8d57f193f /? & cid = N5F6B3DF25713 & rid = 8d39caf583e2db1a68d4d5de0ac72148 & file: rl = https: / / www.dcaf.ch / sites / default / files / imce / Women's % 2520Guide % 2520Curriculum / I clusiveSecurity Curriculum Series SSR MOD8. pdf & type = originalinstances of unsupportive leadership, discouraging culture and norms, and lack of adequate infrastructure and equipment.

<p>The Department of Energy strives to ensure America's security and prosperity by addressing its energy, environmental and nuclear challenges through transformative science and technology solutions. DOE prioritizes equity and place - based 1 strategies in its investments to model a clean energy transition that will deliver real benefits to frontline communities, especially those historically impacted by the legacy of pollution and environmental injustice. To ensure that every community has a role in this energy transition, DOE must strive to eliminate <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 139, 0, 0.3)" title="barriers">barriers</span> to access, transform programs and policies to open even broader pathways for underrepresented groups to access DOE resources, and create new programs to better serve communities. </p></article>

DOE created the Office of State and Community Energy Programs to administer state and community - facing programs, including the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP). The following bullets outline key accomplishments in WAP since the publication of the April 2022 EAP. On February 3, 2023, DOE published allocations of $ 30M for Weatherization Readiness from the FY 2023 WAP appropriation, an increase of $ 15M from FY 2022. DOE WAP and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) launched a Weatherization Workforce Development Pilot in February 2023 to enhance impact in four communities: Lowell, MA; Roanoke, VA; Chicago, IL; and Warner Robins, GA. The program connects HUD residents to weatherization jobs within Community Action Agencies and sets up residents for careers in green construction. This partnership aims to support the utilization of DOE Weatherization Assistance Program funds by adequately <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 139, 0.3)" title="Teams">staffing</span> the weatherization programs in local communities. Several of the communities have begun hosting job fairs to share information and recruit HUD residents interested in weatherization work. Sustainable Energy Resources for Consumers (SERC) funding is available to WAP grantees, subgrantees, and non - profit organizations to demonstrate innovative technologies and approaches that go beyond the scope of the formula WAP. These grants offer more flexibility than the WAP formula grants and unique opportunities to broaden the impact of WAP. The second round of SERC funding was announced in October 2022. DOE anticipates awarding eleven grantees $ 17M with 2023 SERC funds. The projects will install various renewables, including solar technologies and heat pumps. In June 2022, DOE published WPN 22 - 9, Managing Multiple Funding Streams. This policy update provides clarification on the allowability of braiding DOE funds with other federal and non - federal funding sources to expand and enhance the services provided to low - income households. </p></article>

On October 12, 2022, EJE met with the Alliance of Hispanic Research Universities. At that time, the Alliance consisted of 21 universities which were both Hispanic - Serving Institutions as defined by Title V of the Higher Education Act and in the top 5 % of universities in the U.S. for research as determined by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. The meeting was held to discuss opportunities to increase diversity in the federal work force and DOE's grant recipient pool in accordance with DOE's <span style="background-color: rgba(93, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="climate">Justice40</span> implementation initiatives. In FY 2023, EJE was represented by the Minority Business and Workforce Division at the Annual U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce (USHCC) Legislative Summit held in Washington, D.C. The USHCC actively promotes the economic growth, development, and interests of more than 4.7 million Hispanic - owned businesses. During this event, DOE presented to Hispanic owned energy businesses on funding opportunities available through various DOE program offices. </p></article>

<p>In July 2023, DOE announced the 67 winners of the first phase of the Energizing Rural Communities Prize. The cohort included 17 Tribes, or teams, serving Tribal communities. Each of the 67 winners will receive $ 100,000, in - kind - mentorship services, and eligibility to compete in phase two of the prize to win an additional $ 200,000. One of the winning teams is Sustainable Energy for Galena Alaska, a nonprofit run jointly by the Louden Tribal Council, the Galena City School District, and the City of Galena. See Community Profile: What Energizing Rural Communities Means for Galena, Alaska. About 400 people live in Galena year - round, and the economy is based around the schools there that draw over 50 villages ' high school students for boarding school. DOE is funding holistic energy planning for Sustainable Energy for Galena Alaska. DOE's <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 185, 0.3)" title="community engagement">participation</span> in the Rural Partners Network (RPN), which is led by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the White House Rural Prosperity Interagency Policy Council, builds relationships with rural communities across the Nation, especially in the states and communities designated to be prioritized by RPN. DOE employs a Rural Desk Officer, who actively participates in the network. One component of the RPN is the selection of signature projects in communities that have been identified by the network as priority areas. For example, DOE is the lead for the San Carlos Apache Tribe's solar project, which was awarded $ 4M in FY 2023 year. Upon completion, the project will add 750 kW of solar photovoltaic systems and a 500 - kW Battery Energy Storage System to its diesel generators to serve 36 residential buildings for healthcare workers and five hospital buildings at the San Carlos Apache Healthcare Corporation community. DOE has several offices that offer programs that directly benefit rural communities by providing technical assistance, loans, tax incentives and funding that supports the clean energy transition. Some examples include: The Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), which manages the Energy Improvements in Rural or Remote Areas program that supports energy investments in rural and remote areas through clean energy projects to improve reliability and / or resilience of energy systems, reduce energy poverty, and improve environmental performance of energy generation in rural or remote communities. The Office of Indian Energy, which selected 18 American Indian and Alaska Native communities to receive $ 34M in funding to advance clean energy technology. The funding strengthens Tribal communities by increasing their access to solar power and microgrids, increasing energy security and resilience, and powering unelectrified Tribal buildings. The Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC) plays a critical and unique role in catalyzing investments in America's energy future to support the reshoring, skilling, and scaling of U.S. manufacturing across energy supply chains. MESC addresses critical vulnerabilities in U.S. energy supply chains, serves as the frontline of clean energy capital </p></article>

<p>Although inconsistent, several offices across DOE have collected R & D impact metrics, such as the number of peer - reviewed journal articles, patents, licenses, new companies formed, and the amount of follow - on funding received from the private sector. Challenges to these current efforts include: Many of these achievements occur after a project is closed out, when awardees are no longer reporting on the project and have likely moved onto other projects. As a result, many of these outputs are not appropriately attributed to DOE funding. One study of the Web of Science - a public database of scientific articles - found that in some subject areas, as little as 28 % of the articles had any acknowledgements, and of those only 65 % acknowledged funding. 9 If funding is properly acknowledged, web - crawling techniques can be used to extract subsequent impacts. Existing project impact metrics fail to address equity or justice. There are infrequent third - party reviews of <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="accountability">evaluation</span> metrics. These reviews are costly, time - intensive, and limited by confidential business information restrictions. There is limited interaction and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 185, 0.3)" title="community engagement">participation</span> with citizen / community science in the development of DOE R & D strategies and metrics. There have been several approaches across the federal Government to address the foregoing challenges: In the Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA - E), there are <span style="background-color: rgba(232, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Staff Experience">staff</span> who follow up with past recipients to collect research outputs / publications. In the DOE Office of Science, there is an annual automated reminder to past awardees to update their profile, including information regarding publications. Existing literature shows a lack of equity consideration in R & D metrics. To fill this gap, NREL developed the Justice Underpinning Science and Technology Research (JUST - R) metrics framework - energy justice metrics specifically targeted at early - stage research. 10 Some offices have project - specific metrics. For example, DOE's Building Technology Office requires applicants of some FOAs to provide estimates of energy, cost, and emissions savings using the Resilient and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 185, 255, 0.3)" title="Customer Service">Efficient</span> Codes Implementation (RECI) Impact Calculator tool - a spreadsheet - based tool for building code updates in new construction, improvements to existing buildings, and improvements in energy codes compliance. 11 Since <span style="background-color: rgba(93, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="climate">climate</span> change disproportionately impacts low - income and minority </p></article>

<p>A. 2022 Equity Action Plan Update (pursuant to EO 13985): For reference, the 2022 DOE Equity Action Plan can be found here. i. Progress on addressing gaps in <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 139, 0.3)" title="Teams">data collection</span> to facilitate data - informed decision - making. Office of Management, Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) OAM implemented an agency - wide BIL funding opportunity announcement (FOA) template for BIL and IRA actions to further the Administration's goals to advance equity, provide support for disadvantaged communities, and leverage federal resources to achieve these objectives. The FOA template includes a Community Benefits Plan requirement, along with requirements to collect equity and justice - focused data. OAM, the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU), and the National Nuclear Safety Administration are co - leading an Acquisition Forecast Improvement Working Group to establish a centralized, web - based platform capturing all contracting, subcontracting and financial assistance opportunities at DOE and better reach underrepresented businesses in DOE procurement opportunities. ii. Progress on increasing opportunities for new applicants to DOE funding opportunities. Office of Management, OAM OAM implemented a strategy with M & O contractors and major site and facility contractors designed to increase subcontracting opportunities from contractors who employ people who are blind or have significant disabilities (AbilityOne). As a result of this implementation, DOE - wide AbilityOne obligations increased from $ 27.5M in FY 2022 to $ 31.2M in FY 2023, an increase of 13 %. OAM continues to co - lead the Innovative Funding Mechanisms Working Group with the Office of General Counsel, which is exploring innovative mechanisms to increase <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 185, 0.3)" title="community engagement">participation</span> in DOE funding opportunities. The Working Group has focused on Partnership Intermediary Agreements (PIAs) and Other Transactions (OT) Authority as possible pathways to reach underrepresented entities and communities. PIAs are best utilized when traditional contractual mechanisms do not provide adequate outreach with non - traditional contractors and can reduce <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 139, 0, 0.3)" title="barriers">barriers</span> to entry for such entities. DOE has put a Pilot PIA agreement in place to extend the Department's reach to new entrants and non - traditional partners, as well as small business firms, universities, and non - profit organizations. The agency has awarded one project utilizing the PIA mechanism, and additional projects are in the planning phase. Additionally, the agency has developed an OT guide for DOE program offices to increase the utilization of OT Authorities department wide. The agency anticipates that these interventions will increase contracting opportunities with new entrants and non - traditional partners. OAM undertook an initiative in the Office of Headquarters Procurement Services to utilize market research tools such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise - Wide Procurement Provider Lookup Tool, Small Business </p></article>

<p>In FY 2022, SC launched Reaching a New Energy Sciences Workforce (RENEW) to establish a more targeted and intentional approach to building foundations to support undergraduate and graduate student training opportunities and support institutions historically underrepresented in the SC research portfolio. RENEW leverages the agency's unique National Laboratories, user facilities, and other research infrastructures to provide training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty. In FY 2022, SC announced 41 RENEW awards totaling $ 32M to 37 institutions, including 24 MSIs. In FY 2023, SC issued seven RENEW solicitations and awarded $ 70M in funding to 65 institutions, including 40 MSIs. In FY 2023, SC launched the Funding for Accelerated, Inclusive Research Initiative to build research capacity, infrastructure, and expertise at non - R1 institutions and support mutually beneficial relationships between MSIs and Emerging Research Institutions and partner institutions. SC has announced $ 37M in funding for 52 projects to 44 institutions to perform basic research in applied mathematics, biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, geoscience, isotope research, materials science, and physics.

SC nearly doubled the number of new awards to HSIs in FY 2022 (from 71 awards in FY 2021 to 136 awards in FY 2022). In FY 2023, SC established a requirement that all research proposals submitted to SC include a plan for Promoting Inclusive and Equitable Research (PIER). PIER Plans describe the strategies and activities the applicants will incorporate into their research projects to promote opportunity, inclusion, and access to STEM research and training for individuals from all backgrounds. PIER Plans are <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="accountability">evaluated</span> as part of the merit review process. Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM) FECM is collaborating with National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) acquisition professionals to embed societal and community impact criteria into FOAs - whether mandated by BIL or IRA, or program directed - that expand the pool of new entrants (e.g., MSIs) participating in program procurement, acquisition, and development activities. FECM's University Training and Research (UTR) program supports novel, early - stage research at U.S. colleges and universities, with an emphasis on student training. The UTR program has a sub - program dedicated to supporting projects specifically at HBCUs and other MSIs; in FY 2023, FECM made 18 awards totaling more than $ 7M with nearly half (10 awards) going to MSIs (totaling nearly $ 3.5M). (See University Training and Research netl.doe.gov.) FECM held a workshop (April 2023) for potential future grant applicants to provide information about the UTR program and the associated application process. Over 90 people from educational institutions participated. In June 2023, FECM announced up to $ 17.7M in available funding (FOA 3002) for five different areas of interest, including establishing multi - institution collaborations for student exchanges from MSIs, new academic curricula related to geosciences, supporting interdisciplinary training in humanities - driven STEM fields. </p></article>

" " As emphasized in the May 2015 report, entitled " " Final Report of the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing, " " building trust and nurturing legitimacy on both sides of the police / citizen divide serves as the foundational principle underlying the nature of relations between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve. Police cannot fulfill their role to keep communities safe without public trust and confidence in law enforcement and the criminal justice system. Yet, there are places in America today where the bonds of trust are frayed or broken. To heal as a Nation, we must acknowledge </p></article>

<p>As the Department continues evolving in the work of EO 14091, entitled " " Further Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, " " we recognize the nexus to many other simultaneous initiatives and action plans including gender, <span style="background-color: rgba(93, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="climate">climate</span>, and education, which complement the work detailed in this 2023 Equity Action Plan. In response to EO 14020, the Department's Gender Strategy Action Plan was published in August 2022. This plan identified four focus areas which have seen both clear progress and some persistent challenges. The Council will continue its efforts to overcome challenges and achieve gender equity. With respect to EO 14008, the Department has developed its 2021 <span style="background-color: rgba(93, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="climate">Climate</span> Action Plan and the 2022 <span style="background-color: rgba(93, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="climate">Climate</span> Adaption and Resilience Plan Progress Report, which establish and update the Department's progress on specific <span style="background-color: rgba(93, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="climate">climate</span> - related action items. Specific to equity, the Department embraces the second action item, to " " advance <span style="background-color: rgba(93, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="climate">climate</span> equity " " in a collaborative manner across departmental functions. Finally, with regard to EO 13988, the Department's dedicated working group's activities resulted in many successes including the Department's first Transgender Day of Visibility. Additional activities include the continual <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="accountability">evaluation</span> of written materials, including policies, forms, and web content to ensure the usage of gender - neutral <span style="background-color: rgba(93, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="language accessibility">language</span>. </p></article>

New entrants to the Federal procurement process lack experience and understanding of how to access opportunities and the various methods that DOI uses to procure goods and services. Communication. During DOI's listening sessions, participants indicated frustration with the communication between the Department and vendors, including identifying the appropriate individuals within Bureaus to help them, response rates, and obtaining information about specific opportunities before and after award.

<p>Individuals may face challenges accessing DOI - managed sites due to the remote nature of many public lands. Accessing public lands often requires a personal vehicle - 4 - wheel drive or high clearance vehicles are often required - and there are limited alternative transportation options (e.g., public transit, alternative access, pedestrian and cycling trails) for visitors. Costs may serve as a <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 139, 0, 0.3)" title="barriers">barrier</span> to access as not all people have the means to travel to, or participate in, recreational activities on DOI - managed lands.

The Department also developed and provided training to all Contracting Officers on the use of the Buy Indian Act. The DOI collaborated with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to hold the first - ever joint industry day event focused on outreach to Indian - owned businesses. This event provided a learning opportunity for Indian - owned businesses to grow their understanding of the Government contracting process and to hear from top executives from both agencies about upcoming business opportunities. </p></article>

<p>Officer Mental Health, Wellness, and Safety: Police officer mental health, wellness, and safety are important to achieving equity. When officers face high levels of stress, trauma, or mental health challenges, it can impact their interactions with the community and undermine their ability to serve and protect their communities safely and effectively. This <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 139, 0, 0.3)" title="barriers">barrier</span> becomes evident through a recent survey of Department law enforcement personnel. The findings revealed that: Only 62 percent rate their mental health as " " good " " or " " great " " during core job functions. Over the last 6 months, 43 percent have experienced mental health concerns. Only 52 percent believe there are sufficient resources for their mental health support. Law Enforcement Program Effectiveness: In October 2022, the Department announced a series of updated policies that will help advance safe, transparent, <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="accountability">accountable</span>, and effective policing practices; build public trust; and strengthen public safety. The policies provide clear guidelines on use of force standards, require DOI officers to wear body - worn cameras, and restrict the use of no - knock warrants. These policy updates were part of the Department's continuing implementation of President Biden's May 2022 EO 14074, entitled " " Advancing Effective, <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="accountability">Accountable</span> Policing and Criminal Justice Practices to Enhance Public Trust and Public Safety.

For example, starting in FY 2024, if relevant to the operations of a grantmaking component, a survey instrument will be appended to applicable funding solicitations to gather the required data to determine if equity actions are leading to an increase in applications from population - specific organizations. </p></article>

<p>For instance, formerly incarcerated people face difficulty acquiring State - issued identification cards when reentering society because many of them do not have necessary proof of identity or residency documents upon release and the prison or jail records they do have are not accepted by State agencies. Lack of State - issued identification is a substantial <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 139, 0, 0.3)" title="barriers">barrier</span> to successful reentry because it can prevent individuals from accessing critical physical and mental health wraparound resources and supports, housing, employment, and other benefits. Also, many formerly incarcerated people are burdened by debt from court - issued fines and fees as they seek to reenter society.

<p>Within the past year, DOL agencies have engaged meaningfully with stakeholders and community partners; this has intrinsically informed our approach to the Equity Action Plan. We conducted strategic meetings with workers, community leaders, and businesses within the Southeast, and found that workers were significantly more likely to face wage violations and fewer worker protections, as well as decreased coalition building. In April 2023, we held an extensive workshop with stakeholders to brainstorm and discuss solutions for employment rates among formerly incarcerated individuals, which will inform our work to increase access to pilot job readiness <span style="background-color: rgba(232, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Staff Experience">trainings</span> for this underserved demographic.

<p>Improving wages and working conditions in key, female - dominated sectors In support of EO 14095, Executive Order on Increasing Access to High - Quality Care and Supporting Caregivers, the Wage and Hour Division (WHD) and WB are collaborating through an MOU to promote the rights of the care workforce by creating sample employment agreements for domestic workers that provide child and long - term care to negotiate the terms of employment, facilitating compliance and awareness of labor law and best practices, and incorporate <span style="background-color: rgba(93, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="language accessibility">language</span> to embed the requirements of relevant worker protection laws. WB will work with elected officials to support investments in care infrastructure, strengthen the majority female workforce that performs essential work, and provide technical assistance through the Good Jobs Great Cities Academy. OSHA Rulemaking in progress: OSHA is currently developing Prevention of Workplace Violence in Health Care and Social Assistance, a standard on workplace violence prevention in the healthcare and social assistance industries, occupations which tend to employ significantly more women than men WB will continue <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 46, 0.3)" title="collaboration">working with</span> HHS to elevate ways to build equity in wages and job quality in female dominated sectors through the DOL - HHS workgroup, and technical assistance to agencies for support services. Reducing caregiving penalties for women and low - paid workers In FY 2024, the WB will continue to expand and tailor the National Database of Childcare Prices (NDCP), in collaboration with ICF International and HHS, to develop key analytical tools to <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="accountability">evaluate</span> how childcare prices are linked with gender and racial inequality in the labor force. WB is partnering with the Urban Institute to conduct the project, Understanding Equity in Paid Leave through Microsimulation Analysis. This project will provide research and technical assistance to states or local jurisdictions considering paid leave programs, and answer new questions about policy impacts, costs, and benefits of paid leave policies. Eliminating gender - based discrimination in the workplace DOL will contribute key deliverables toward the implementation of the National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality and the National Plan to End Gender - Based Violence, including: In FY 2024, WB will administer its Fostering Access, Rights, and Equity (FARE) grant, focusing the program to support women who have been impacted by gender - based violence and harassment in the world of work. As the federal government makes historic investments in infrastructure, OFCCP intends to develop a best practices document outlining how federal contractors and subcontractors can create safe environments free from gender - based violence and harassment. In anticipation of the FAR Council's rulemaking prohibiting salary history inquiries by federal contractors, OFCCP plans to publish sub - regulatory guidance clarifying how reliance on salary history for hiring and compensation decisions may result in discrimination under Executive Order 11246. </p></article>

<p>Education can have a transformational impact on an individual's life - and education plays a vital role in easing an individual's reentry from jail or prison back into society. Studies have found that a postsecondary education helps justice - impacted people who were formerly incarcerated find jobs upon release, support their families, and contribute positively to their communities. Research also shows that access to education in prison lowers the odds of recidivating by 43 percent and saves taxpayers up to $ 5 for every $ 1 spent. 26 However, policies have traditionally exacerbated the <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 139, 0, 0.3)" title="barriers">barriers</span> that incarcerated people face when attempting to continue their education, including inadequate funding, local labor market trends and employer needs, statutory and administrative restrictions, and a lack of incentives and support to promote <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 185, 0.3)" title="community engagement">participation</span> in education. 27 </p></article>

First, thanks to President Biden's historic investments in public education, including providing $ 122 billion in American Rescue Plan (ARP) funds for Title I Schools, this plan includes supporting State and local efforts to accelerate learning and provide a comprehensive, rigorous, and academically excellent education to every student. Second, we're improving learning conditions with new efforts to elevate, grow, and diversify the teaching profession, leveraging the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act's bold investments to help address chronic absenteeism, better supporting students ' mental health and positive school climates, and advancing robust parent and family <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 185, 0.3)" title="community engagement">engagement</span> in schools. Third, we're focused on creating opportunities for students of all backgrounds to succeed in our globally competitive society and by investing in multilingual learning and reimagining pathways to college and careers. Finally, we are working to increase college affordability and completion SO that all students have access to quality, postsecondary education that leads to careers that provide economic mobility and stability. </p></article>

<p>Across States, districts serving students of color, students from low - income backgrounds, English learners, and other underserved groups tend to receive less State funding than lower poverty districts. For example, an analysis by The Education Trust indicated that high - poverty districts receive, on average, 5 percent less (about $ 800 per student) combined State and local revenue than low - poverty districts. Following the Great Recession, high - poverty districts experienced an inequitable share of funding and <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 139, 0.3)" title="Teams">staffing</span> cuts.

Prioritized college access and college completion as accessibility, affordability, equitable funding, and verification remain <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 139, 0, 0.3)" title="barriers">barriers</span> to postsecondary education. Improved Accessibility: In the wake of the Supreme Court ruling last summer limiting the ability of colleges to consider an applicant's race in and of itself as a factor in deciding whether to admit an applicant, the Department provided colleges and universities with resources on what admissions practices and programs remain lawful to ensure diversity, convened a National Summit on Educational Opportunity, and released a report on strategies for increasing diversity and educational opportunity. The Department also awarded over $ 40 million in Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) and TRIO Upward Bound grants in FY23 for programs focused on helping low - income students, first - generation students, and students with disabilities gain access to college. Improved Affordability: The Department worked to secure a $ 500 hundred increase in the maximum Pell Grant award, the largest increase in 10 years, in the FY23 Omnibus Appropriations bill and awarded $ 22 million in grants to colleges to address students ' basic needs, including food, housing, transportation, and childcare earlier this fiscal year. The Department has implemented a number of efforts over the last year to ease repayment and reduce debt burden for student loan borrowers, which disproportionately impacts low - income students and students of color, including recently approving an additional $ 9 billion in debt relief through fixes to income - drive repayment (IDR) and Public Student Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) programs and granting automatic relief for borrowers with total and permanent disabilities, bringing the total approved debt cancellation to $ 127 billion for nearly 3.6 million Americans. The Department also rolled out initial implementation of the SAVE plan last fall, which is the most affordable repayment plan ever created, and has already enrolled more than 4 million borrowers. Equalized Funding: The Department worked to secure a significant increase in appropriations for programs to strengthen HBCUs, TCUs, HSIs and MSIs in the FY23 budget. The Department issued Notices Inviting Applications (NIAs) for and awarded a number of Title III / V grant programs to strengthen HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs, including Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander - serving institutions (AANAPISIs) and HSIs over the last year, and published the NIA for the new $ 50 million HBCU, TCU, and MSI Research and Development Infrastructure grant last summer, which aims to provide funds to implement transformational investments in research infrastructure, including research productivity, faculty expertise, graduate programs, physical infrastructure, human capital development, and partnerships leading to increases in external funding. </p></article>

Educational attainment of people who are incarcerated or confined and justice - impacted learners is incredibly important. Unfortunately, many people in prison lack the education and workforce skills they need to succeed in the labor market. Fifty - eight percent of people who are incarcerated do not complete an education program while in prison. 24 Limited - skilled individuals caught up in the incarceration cycle may not be able to access educational programs. Given that education is an important determinant of social and economic well - being, 25 it is critical to reconnect this population to educational opportunities. Investments in rehabilitative measures can help facilitate the successful completion of secondary education, as well as transitions to postsecondary education and the labor market. </p></article>

Including this fourth principle reflects the critical need to infuse the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all people into EPA's policies, practices, and programs. </p></article>

<p>No community should bear a disproportionate share of adverse environmental or public health consequences from the nation's economic and other activities. Pursuant to Executive Order 14096, historically marginalized communities overburdened by the cumulative impacts ¹ ¹ of environmental and social stressors should be afforded the full protection of government agencies and programs. This will be accomplished by leveraging coordination and collaboration in addressing cumulative impacts, with whole - of - government approaches involving multiple programs and agencies. Such efforts will be supported by " " fit - for - purpose " " analytic methods and data appropriate for the decision context involved (e.g., allocation of resources, permitting, enforcement, rulemaking, and standard - setting), consistent with statutory authorities. Government decision - making should address the historical drivers of the inequitable concentration of environmental burden, such as redlining and urban renewal, as well as the inequitable impacts of <span style="background-color: rgba(93, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="climate">climate</span> change.

<p>In March 2022, reached a settlement with Chevron Phillips Chemical Company to install and operate air pollution controls at three petrochemical manufacturing facilities in Texas located in areas of <span style="background-color: rgba(93, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="climate">environmental justice</span> concern; monitoring results will be publicly posted, and corrective actions are required if emissions exceed certain thresholds. Took aggressive, early enforcement actions in communities with <span style="background-color: rgba(93, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="climate">environmental justice</span> concerns: In August 2022, following negotiations that considered concerns voiced by the local community, secured a preliminary injunction for the Toa Alta Municipal Solid Waste Landfill to take immediate action to address urgent human health and environmental concerns. Issued two Clean Air Act emergency orders to shut down the Limetree Refinery in the U.S. Virgin Islands (June 2021) where residents were sickened by excess sulfur and hydrogen sulfide emissions and to cut hydrogen sulfide emissions from the New Indy plant in South Carolina (May 2021). Provided more enforcement information to communities about facilities, pollution, and enforcement activities through press releases, desk statements, public meetings, and websites focused on specific communities and incidents (e.g., Refinery on St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, H2S in South and North Carolina, Toa Alta Landfill in Puerto Rico). Increased efforts to obtain input from communities on potential remedies prior to finalizing settlement agreements. Developed analytical approaches to address <span style="background-color: rgba(93, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="climate">environmental justice</span> implications of major regulatory proposals and final rules. For example, For the Oil and Natural Gas New Source Performance Standard proposal (November 2021) and the Supplemental Proposal (November 2022), EPA held virtual <span style="background-color: rgba(232, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Staff Experience">trainings</span> (900 + participants) marketed to communities with <span style="background-color: rgba(93, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="climate">environmental justice</span> concerns and Tribes to assist their ability to understand and comment meaningfully on the proposal. EPA's proposal included requirements for states to undertake <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 185, 0.3)" title="community engagement">meaningful</span> outreach and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 185, 0.3)" title="community engagement">engagement</span> with communities with <span style="background-color: rgba(93, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="climate">environmental justice</span> concerns as they develop their plans for regulating existing oil and gas sources under the emissions guidelines. In the final nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission standards for trucks, conducted analyses of the number and demographics of the populations living within close proximity to truck freight routes. This final rule will likely result in widespread air quality improvements across the U.S., especially in areas already overburdened by air pollution and diesel emissions, beginning with model year 2027. In July 2023, issued proposed rules to strengthen lead paint standards to protect against childhood lead exposure. Developed a Strategy to Reduce Lead Exposures and Disparities in US Communities to advance EPA's work to protect the public from lead with an emphasis on high - risk communities. Announced the allotment of $ 2.865B FY 2023 funds from the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund for identification and replacement of lead service lines (LSLs). As part of the Lead Service Line Replacement (LSLR) Accelerators, EPA and 4 state partners are <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 46, 0.3)" title="collaboration">working with</span> 40 communities to address existing <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 139, 0, 0.3)" title="barriers">barriers</span> and accelerate progress towards LSL identification and replacement.

<p>subgrants to communities in their regional coverage areas in amounts between $ 100 - 350K. These subgrants will essentially replace EPA's traditional grant programs such as the <span style="background-color: rgba(93, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="climate">EJ</span> Small Grants, which would provide such small levels of support directly to communities through a traditional government grant competition and award process. The subawards through the Grantmakers will achieve two equity goals - greatly reducing the burden capacity - constrained communities face when seeking small amounts of funding directly from the federal government, and also increasing the speed with which communities receive an award. EPA plans to make at least eleven (11) Grantmaker awards across the United States with $ 50M each, of which at least $ 40M must be directly subawarded to capacity - constrained communities.

<p>Gaps in capacity and coordination within the federal family to support economic revitalization, infrastructure improvements, and other community - specific needs. Rural communities can include underserved persons who experience inconsistent access to safe drinking water and sanitation services, due to either personal resources (e.g., homeowner well or septic system) or lack of ratepayers for public system maintenance or improvements. Rural economies are more dependent on natural resources, which may be disproportionately affected by pollution, chemical exposures, and from <span style="background-color: rgba(93, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="climate">climate</span> change. Rural communities may receive inequitable access to information and EPA opportunities (e.g., unreliable internet access). When equity screening information is needed or encouraged for competitive funding opportunities, a lack of robust data can inadvertently disadvantage rural communities ' ability to successfully compete for these resources (e.g., identification of communities in EJScreen and other screening tools). Requirements of funding opportunities, imposed through statute, regulation, or practice, can create additional burdens on rural communities (e.g., to perform a feasibility study). Limited access to resources (materials, skilled labor, expert consultants, etc.) in rural communities can result in more costly project expenses, delayed timelines, and / or incorrectly scoped projects. </p></article>

Investment is needed in planning, data infrastructure, and technical support to strengthen data quality and data management to support the use of community - generated data. Anticipated receiving organizations in state, Tribal, and local governments need to be consulted and resourced to integrate and use community science in decision - making. Connecting hubs are needed between communities, technical support providers, and receptors in local, state, and federal government for the creation and use of community science. Resources (e.g., <span style="background-color: rgba(232, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Staff Experience">staff</span>, financial, technical) are needed along the full data pathway from community, universities / technical support, to local, state, and federal entities to enable successful integration of participatory science into decision - making. </p></article>

<p>The mission of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) is to deliver the best <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 185, 255, 0.3)" title="Customer Service">customer</span> experience and value in real estate, acquisition, and technology services to the government and the American people. As we work to meet our goals of delivery on behalf of the government, we are only meeting our mission as a federal agency if the American people can equitably benefit from our efforts. That means that as GSA leverages its over $ 85 billion buying power to provide Federal purchasers with cost - effective, high - quality products and services from commercial vendors, we are also advancing the diversity of the American supplier base and economic security for small businesses. When we provide critical technology services and modernizations, GSA has a mission to ensure that digital government is reflective of and designed to perform for all the diverse communities we serve. As GSA plans and completes large scale construction projects across our 375 million rentable square feet of Federal real estate, we do so in a manner that is informed by local communities to ensure that the sustainability, vitality and livability made possible through Federal investment is available to every American neighborhood. GSA's mission is government delivery - and that includes delivering on the American promise of equal opportunity, civil rights, and justice for all. </p></article>

<p>Although technology continues to rapidly evolve, persistent inequities in technology design and delivery - like higher false rejection rates, completion failure rates, and time burdens - disproportionately negatively impact those from historically and socially marginalized communities. Additionally, digital services very often fail to prioritize human - centered design and usability beyond compliance. This means that Americans who likely have a critical need to connect with government information and services through digital platforms also are likely to have the hardest time doing SO. Examples include both lack of access to the newest hardware or good internet, which often means newer digital platforms do not perform as well (because they are not built for older devices or don't work with low bandwidth connections), or software that is not designed to work across all populations, such as lack of plain <span style="background-color: rgba(93, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="language accessibility">language</span> impacting populations with <span style="background-color: rgba(93, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="language accessibility">limited English proficiency</span> or poorly trained Al models causing biometric systems to perform worse for people with different ages or skin tones.

<p>Implement the Good Jobs Initiative partnership with the U.S. Department of Labor to create and support clear pathways for workers to high - quality, good - paying jobs in construction, maintenance, manufacturing, and operations. The actions outlined in the signed Memorandum of Understanding1 aim to support equitable and effective workforce development, including those from nontraditional and underserved labor sources; and improve job quality, standards and metrics on GSA construction sites. Build and release new Geographic Information System (GIS) data - informed public forecasting resources for BIL and IRA related construction projects. GIS is a computer system that analyzes and displays geographically referenced information. It uses data that is attached to a unique location. By providing more visibility and transparency about where and when Federal projects are happening, GSA can help Federal contractors, trade labor, and community stakeholders effectively plan and better connect with opportunities. This effort will help more Americans, including those from underserved communities, with access to quality employment in their communities. Increase contracting opportunities for socioeconomically disadvantaged small businesses across growing markets in construction, clean energy, and sustainability. GSA will take actions aimed to maximize <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 185, 0.3)" title="community engagement">participation</span> of SDB and build its small business contractor base by improving the forecasting process, strengthening relationships with existing contractors, executing its plans for industry <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 185, 0.3)" title="community engagement">engagement</span> and utilizing the Governmentwide Procurement Equity Tool to identify eligible and new businesses ready to bid for work where GSA projects are located. </p></article>

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) provides $ 3.4 billion for GSA's Public Buildings Service, making a significant impact on 26 Land Ports of Entry modernizations along the Canadian and Mexican border. These projects will create new good - paying jobs, bolster safety and security, and make our economy more resilient to supply chain challenges - all while serving as models for sustainability and innovation and improving community livability. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provides GSA with $ 2.15 billion for low - embodied carbon materials in construction and renovation projects, $ 975 million for GSA to support emerging and sustainable technologies, and $ 250 million to turn even more GSA facilities into High - Performance Green Buildings and accelerate efforts to achieve a net - zero Federal footprint. These investments will reduce long - term energy costs for American communities, strengthen America's domestic industrial base and catalyze innovation and job growth in homegrown industries that produce next - generation materials, products, and equipment. GSA estimates that these projects will create over 9,500 average annual economy - wide jobs across the length of the projects, support $ 2.8 billion in labor income, and generate nearly $ 1 billion in tax revenue for Federal, State and local governments. </p></article>

<p>Preventing Child Welfare System Involvement: We understand that families in poverty and those in Tribal and other communities are impacted by the child welfare system more than others, in some cases largely because they lack sufficient access to economic resources and community networks. Our efforts will be directed at connecting families in need to supports that enable them to stay together and preventing discriminatory and other practices that make it difficult for children, youth, and families to heal when child welfare is involved. Promoting Accessible and Welcoming Health Care: A lack of health insurance coverage and social and geographic <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 139, 0, 0.3)" title="barriers">barriers</span> to care mean that not everyone is receiving health care that meets their needs within their communities. Our actions will promote access to comprehensive insurance coverage and quality care designed to meet the diverse needs of Americans so everyone can benefit from preventive care and effective treatments. Improving Maternal Health Outcomes: Too many women, particularly racial and ethnic minority populations, and those in rural areas, are losing their lives or health during pregnancy or after giving birth. Our actions will address gaps in insurance coverage and the birthing care infrastructure to ensure better maternal health outcomes. Meeting Behavioral Health Needs: The impact of the COVID - 19 pandemic increased mental health and substance use challenges for all populations, but disproportionately exacerbated the already existing behavioral health disparities among underserved racial, ethnic, and sexual minority populations. The rising rates of suicide, depression, anxiety, and substance misuse among youth and adults are impacted by a decreasing workforce, limited resources, underinsurance, and lack of culturally competent care. Our actions will improve access to behavioral health care coverage and ensure that prevention and treatment are accessible and meet the needs of all populations. Advancing Clinical Innovation: To increase our understanding of what treatments are most effective for which populations, we need to increase the diversity of our research and clinical trials to inform that science. Our actions will engage a more diverse set of populations in informing our efforts and participating in clinical research so that we can innovate to improve health and well - being outcomes. </p></article>

This process ensures meeting federal child welfare requirements, determining what is happening to children and families as they are engaged in child welfare services, and assists states in enhancing their capacity to help children and families achieve positive outcomes. Through these reviews, states and ACF engage impacted communities - including youth, parents, foster parents, Tribes, courts and child welfare workers - to review data on performance and identify strengths and areas needing improvement within their agencies and programs. </p></article>

From 426 entries, ten community - based organizations were selected as winners of the challenge in August 2023. These winners presented and documented the impact of their innovative strategies in mental health, substance use prevention, and substance use treatment across historically underserved communities. Recognition will be given to these winners through various presentations and showcases sponsored by SAMHSA. SAMHSA hosted a Policy Academy on Black Youth Suicide to develop a strategic plan to address high rates of suicide among Black youth. Teams from 8 states (GA, IN, KY, LA, MD, OH, OR, PA) convened to address their specific state's needs, work with experts in suicide prevention, and develop policy strategies to take back to their states. They will continue to receive technical assistance sponsored by SAMHSA and report back. Since 2022, Secretary Becerra and HHS leaders have been traveling across the country to hear directly from Americans about the mental health challenges they're facing and engage with local leaders to strengthen the mental health and crisis care system in our communities. </p></article>

<p>Racial and ethnic minority populations, AI / ANs, older adults, women, pregnant and lactating individuals, LGBTQI + adults and youth, and persons with disabilities continue to be underrepresented in clinical trials, stifling health care innovation, and hindering the generalizability of effective treatments. Lack of diversity in clinical research has the potential to hinder innovation. Including populations that have been underrepresented in clinical trials and medical studies can help researchers better understand variation in the safety and effectiveness of interventions, identify new biological processes, and lead to new discoveries that can benefit other populations. 55 Evidence from clinical studies help inform health recommendations, insurance coverage, and reimbursement of healthcare services. Without representation of specific groups in trials and studies, we may lack confidence about how new therapeutics will impact all populations. A lack of representation in clinical studies can impede access to effective medical interventions for underrepresented groups if they are not included to build the evidence base to begin with. 56 56 Additional <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 139, 0, 0.3)" title="barriers">barriers</span> contributing to underrepresentation of racial and ethnic minority patients ' <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 185, 0.3)" title="community engagement">participation</span> in clinical trials include mistrust or fear and stigma of <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 185, 0.3)" title="community engagement">participation</span>, lack of comfort with the clinical trial process, lack of information about clinical trials, time and resource constraints associated with clinical trial <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 185, 0.3)" title="community engagement">participation</span>, and lack of clinical trial awareness. 57 </p></article>

<p>Gender - based Violence Prevention and Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) Listening Sessions: In February 2023, HUD convened national and community - based organizations that advocate on behalf of survivors to collect feedback on the challenges, implications, and impact of HUD's policy change to the Federal Housing Administration's Single Family Housing Policy Handbook that helps to ensure that domestic violence survivors who own their homes can access loss mitigation programs to assist in retaining their homes and avoid foreclosure. In June 2023, HUD hosted listening sessions with survivor advocacy organizations and housing industry groups to collect feedback on HUD's implementation of VAWA. Further, since the spring of 2022, as required by the 2022 reauthorization of VAWA, HUD has led a study effort that will provide an assessment of trafficking survivors ' housing needs. As part of this work, HUD has engaged extensively with stakeholders in the trafficking, gender - based violence, housing, and direct services communities, including partners from the government, advocacy, policy, and research sectors. Additionally, HUD is centering the <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 46, 255, 0.3)" title="Knowledge">knowledge</span>, insight, and involvement of labor and sex trafficking survivors by engaging with survivors in listening sessions, roundtables, and ongoing collaboration throughout the analysis and report writing stages of a study titled Housing Needs of Survivors of Human Trafficking that will be delivered to Congress. </p></article>

To better serve individuals and families, HUD has expanded the Family Self Sufficiency program for HUD - assisted residents to initiate a path to realizing their homeownership dreams.

HUD will maximize homeownership for creditworthy first - time homebuyers and preserve homeownership for existing homeowners. Historical data collected from the FHA Annual Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund report, has shown that FHA has consistently maintained an 80 percent or above single - family purchase endorsement for borrowers that are first - time homebuyers. This report has also shown that FHA has maintained a sub 30 percent re - default rate after a loss mitigation action. To continue this trend and improve these metrics, HUD will maximize homeownership for creditworthy first - time homebuyers and preserve homeownership for existing homeowners. By September 30, 2025, HUD will maintain a first - time homebuyer rate of at least 80 % for newly endorsed FHA - insured purchase mortgages and a re - default rate for seriously delinquent homeowners who received a loss mitigation action that is below 30 %. </p></article>

<p>HUD's FHEO Annual Reports on Fair Housing document the number of complaints filed with HUD and Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP) agencies each year. HUD and FHAP agencies consistently receive more than 10,000 complaints per year (11,741 in FY 2022), with disability as the most common basis for alleged discrimination, followed by race and sex. For more than 40 years, HUD's Housing Discrimination studies have documented the persistence of housing discrimination among protected classes. For example, HUD's 2017 study of Rental Housing Discrimination on the Basis of Mental Disabilities found that individuals with mental illness and intellectual or developmental disabilities experienced significant levels of adverse differential treatment in the rental market, including being less likely to receive a response to their inquiries and less likely to be told a unit was available. A 2021 study of Housing Discrimination Against Same - Sex Couples and Transgender Individuals found that housing providers treated lesbians comparably to heterosexual women seeking rental housing, told gay men about fewer available rental units than they told heterosexual men, and told transgender testers about fewer units than they told cisgender home seekers. The pervasive use of criminal background checks during tenant screening can create a <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 139, 0, 0.3)" title="barriers">barrier</span> to renting housing, even though that information may be incomplete or inaccurate and information about past criminal history is not necessarily a reliable predictor of housing success. Studies have also found that Black and Hispanic communities, are disproportionately affected by tenant screening practices that include a criminal background check. A growing body of evidence shows that the provision of housing assistance, particularly when accompanied with supportive services, can help reduce recidivism and decrease involvement in the criminal justice system, thereby strengthening public safety. HUD's forthcoming study of the Housing Needs of Survivors of Human Trafficking finds that survivors of human trafficking and those at risk of trafficking, both highly vulnerable populations, face substantial hurdles in finding affordable housing related to landlord screening for criminal background, credit history, and rental history. </p></article>

HUD published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in October 2023 that would eliminate restrictions on those with prior felony or certain other criminal convictions in FHIP - and FHAP - Funded Testing Programs. HUD will continue to utilize holistic approaches. Provide technical assistance to encourage grantees, Public Housing Authorities (PHAs), and housing owners to use HUD programs to provide housing and services that support people's successful reentry from prisons and jails to the community, which enhances public safety. </p></article>

<p>A large body of literature has investigated the relationship between environmental toxins, race, and poverty. Most notably, the 1987 landmark study by Robert Bullard " " Toxic Waste and Race in the United States " " that demonstrated a correlation between the placement of toxic waste facilities and low - income Black and Brown communities Since then, several studies from interdisciplinary approaches continue to asses environmental injustices as demonstrated in <span style="background-color: rgba(93, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="climate">Environmental Justice</span>: The Economics of Race, Place, and Pollution or seen in the legacies from redlining and pollution. Researcher Diana Hernandez demonstrates in two papers how weatherization can be a catalyst for reducing the energy burden affecting low - income individuals and ultimately improve health and social outcomes among African Americans.

The awarded COEs will conduct innovative research addressing housing, economic development, and the built environment in underserved communities.

This effort is part of a larger ongoing initiative to grow partnerships with HBCUs and other Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) to train the next generation of housing counselors and to empower the next generation of homeowners. The type of activities that will take place through this initiative include: education workshops to inform students on the potential impact of student loans on future housing choices and opportunities; counseling and education, including ways to build credit, to increase homeownership rates of students, faculty, parents, and residents of the greater community; Counseling and education to students, instilling an understanding of the responsibilities of tenancy in off - campus rental housing and internships and training for students to become housing counselors.

<p>In June 2021, NASA received public feedback regarding the Agency's grant programs, regulations, and policies through the RFI process. Further, NASA analyzed proposal submission data from calendar years (CY) 2020 and 2021 to support the feedback received from the June 2021 RFI. NASA found that proposals submitted by organizations from underserved communities represented 13 percent in CY 2020, and 11 percent in CY 2021. NASA determined that these figures demonstrated the reported lack of awareness of NASA programs. In July 2023, NASA issued a second public RFI for feedback on <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 139, 0, 0.3)" title="barriers">barriers</span> for entities that have engaged with and / or applied but are not yet recipients of NASA awards.

<p>C. Additional Efforts to Advance Equity: Examples of recent accomplishments and engagements from which feedback was used to inform this EAP and advance NASA's equity efforts include: ACCESSIBILITY: Among NASA's efforts to increase accessibility are initiatives at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Space Center Houston for Sensory Friendly Hours at visitor centers and numerous STEM materials and programs for students with disabilities. In July 2023, Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex was named a Certified Autism Center. EQUITY for LGBTQI + COMMUNITIES: NASA's Office of Procurement held its first virtual LGBTQI + Vendor Equity Forum, connecting more than 220 industry stakeholders and businesses with Federal procurement experts. The Agency also collaborated with Google Arts & Culture to showcase contributions of LGBTQI + employees. EQUITY FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES: NASA's Earth Science Division embarked on an agriculture - focused tour of Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma to learn how satellite data is used, as well as launched NASA Acres which links scientists with agriculture leaders. Other communication tools include a NASA Harvest website, and SMD's " " 3D Thursdays " " Rural Educator Series. EQUITY IN SPACE: NASA's Artemis missions will launch the first woman and first person of color to orbit the Moon. In 2022, NASA Astronaut and U.S. Marine Corps Col. Nicole Mann became the first Indigenous woman to go to space, while NASA Astronaut Dr. Jessica Watkins became the first Black woman to serve a long - duration mission aboard the orbiting laboratory. NASA also produced and released a documentary The Color of Space, which features a conversation between seven current and former Black NASA astronauts. EQUITY FOR TRIBAL NATIONS: NASA held its inaugural Tribal Nations Forum open to all 574 federally recognized tribes as part of our Tribal Consultation Plan. NASA continues to conduct STEM events with Tribal youth, including the First Nations Launch and a partnership with the Choctaw Nation to support science education.

<p>The metrics for the entire public access initiative are complex, and metrics for efficacy are unfolding. NSF is issuing a Request for Information (RFI) to solicit input from a broad set of communities to identify potential <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 139, 0, 0.3)" title="barriers">barriers</span> to compliance with NSF Public Access policy. Issues brought to NSF's attention via public engagements, the RFI, and other input (e.g., via agency merit review panels and direct information from Pls) will be addressed, and revised guidance for NSF and the researcher community will be developed. This will ensure that policy implementation does not introduce new or further entrench existing inequities in the research publications / data access space. Following this work, the target date for implementing the first phase of policy changes is December 31st, 2025. By this date, new policies for depositing NSF - supported publications and data will be in effect. </p></article>

" " However, agency evidence - building activities and direct efforts to address potential inequities are hampered by an inadequate understanding of who participates in and benefits from NSF - funded activities. NSF has incomplete data on the demography of principal investigators (PIs), reviewers, post - doctoral fellows, teachers, and students. Response rates to current NSF administrative data collections are uneven across demographic groups and diverse types of participants (e.g., Pls, reviewers, fellows, etc.) and, in some cases, are too low to ensure robust conclusions about the <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 185, 0.3)" title="community engagement">participation</span> of members of different groups. This reflects the steady decline in the response rate for many Federal and private - sector surveys over the past few decades (Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology, 2020). In addition, demographic data collected about students, teachers, and post - doctoral fellows has focused on those participating in NSF activities; data about applicants have not routinely been collected until recently. Incomplete and potentially unrepresentative demographic data hampers NSF's ability to <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="accountability">evaluate</span> the impacts of existing investments on different demographic groups and to use evidence to prioritize future investments to advance equity for individuals who are members of groups underrepresented in STEM. </p></article>

<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Asian American Foundation collaborated to support the White House Initiative on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders by introducing the " " Demystifying Federal Grants " " webinar series. This series was created to provide valuable <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 46, 255, 0.3)" title="Knowledge">knowledge</span> and practical advice to assist community - based organizations in successfully applying for federal grants and accessing resources. NSF's chief diversity and inclusion officer (CDIO) has collaborated with a dedicated team of program directors (PDs) to leverage its review and awards process to ensure the Foundation's funded programs can reach the broad pool of untapped scientific talent. These discussions have yielded critical insights into how NSF can better support the inclusion of underrepresented scientists by emphasizing the importance of more general impact statements in grant applications, ensuring diversity within review panels, and increasing <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 185, 0.3)" title="community engagement">participation</span> of researchers from Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). Under the June 2022 Executive Order 14075, Advancing Equality for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex (LGBTQI +) Individuals, the Office of the Chief Statistician of the United States provided recommendations for Federal agencies on best practices to collect self - reported sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data in federal statistical surveys. In an effort led by the CDIO, a dedicated team of individuals across the agency has developed a pilot survey to collect voluntary, non - personally identifiable SOGI data from within the NSF workforce. These efforts are taking place in concert with the National Council of Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) efforts to pilot the collection of SOGI data in their national surveys. D.

<p>research results greatly exceed costs " " and that " " any economic burden falling on individual researchers resulting from a zero - embargo publication policy would likely be offset by the greater benefits of increased visibility, consumption, and potential impact that their research would realize. " " The OSTP Economic Landscape report acknowledges that limited transparency on publication costs indicates that many cost implications are based on estimates. An article by then Acting OSTP Director and her colleagues (Nelson, A., Marcum, C., & Isler, J. (2022). Public Access to Advance Equity.

In addition to recognizing the positive equity impact of public access policies, NSF recognizes potential equity challenges that could arise from public access implementation. The NSF Public Access and Open Science Working Group's Equity of Access subgroup addresses this issue by identifying potential inequities arising from public access guidelines at different implementation phases. The literature points to four specific areas of equity challenges: (1) challenges for researchers and institutions based on resources available for public access implementation; (2) challenges based on methodologies and disciplines based on variation in public access infrastructure; (3) challenges for historically marginalized groups for whom critical issues of reclamation of rights and data sovereignty exist; and (4) challenges for international collaborations due to variation in international regulations and practices in data sharing. To address these challenges, NSF has identified four priority areas to manifest the equity promises of public access policies and minimize challenges. Actions include: <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 139, 0.3)" title="Teams">Consult</span> with Pls and institutions to understand and respond to potential equity challenges. A key priority is focusing on under - represented and under - resourced institutions and the potential for increases in public access implementation costs.

<p>The certification processes for small business contracting programs involves navigating multiple steps during separate online application processes and includes providing documentation for several qualification criteria.

Consolidated buying practices - purchasing services or products in bulk from one or more suppliers to maximize <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 185, 255, 0.3)" title="Customer Service">efficiencies</span> - reduce opportunities for small vendors, including SDBs, to compete for contracts. Contract bundling, a subset of consolidation, takes procurements previously dedicated to small businesses and transforms them into larger, more complex purchases that either expressly or practically exclude small firms. Given that the federal government has an overall 23 percent target goal for small business and socio - economic prime contracting and subcontracting <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 185, 0.3)" title="community engagement">participation</span>, there is a challenge to find the right balance between <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 185, 255, 0.3)" title="Customer Service">efficiency</span> and equity program objectives in federal procurement when considering how federal dollars are allocated. 15 An increased focus on <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 185, 255, 0.3)" title="Customer Service">efficiency</span> via bundling leads to a reduction in the allocation of federal dollars to small firms and, ultimately, underserved communities. </p></article>

This convenient option allows parents to obtain an SSN without having to visit a local Social Security field office or Card Center. However, unlike the standard SSN application, the current EAB process does not collect voluntarily race and ethnicity data. Today, almost all new SSNs are processed through EAB. In FY 2022, EAB accounted for 99 percent of SSNs issued for children under the age of one. The increase in assigning SSNs through EAB led to an unintended 30 plus year period of incomplete voluntary collection of race and ethnicity data in our records. 35 </p></article>

Complete our regulatory agenda 18 to simplify SSI, particularly our In - Kind Support and Maintenance (ISM) policies. Under current policy, ISM refers to reported or estimated assistance with food and / or shelter provided to SSI claimants from others within or outside their households. We determine claimants ' eligibility for and amount of SSI payments, partially based on the amount of ISM they receive. Simplifying ISM policies will make the SSI program easier for the public to understand and less burdensome for us to administer, and reduce the potential for improper payments. Omitting Food from ISM Calculation: Removes food from the calculation of ISM. Food assistance received from others will no longer impact claimants ' benefit eligibility and amount. (NPRM. Feb. 15, 2023. 88 FR 9779.) Expansion of the Rental Subsidy Policy for SSI Applicants and Recipients: Expands rental subsidy exemption currently applicable in seven States nationwide, exempting claimants from ISM from other household members if they pay at least one third of the SSI benefit on rent. (NPRM. Aug. 24, 2023. 88 FR 57910.) Expand the Definition of a Public Assistance (PA) Household: Adds Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to the list of means - tested programs included in our definition of PA households; if every household member receives at least one of the specified types of assistance, we would not reduce SSI benefits due to ISM or deeming from other household members.

<p>1) In June 2022, we resumed publication of statistics on OASDI benefits in current payment status by race as Appendix E in the Annual Statistical Supplement. In August 2023, the Annual Statistical Supplement included updated sets of the 12 tables analyzing payments by race and ethnicity in the body of the publication under Summary 5. A Expanded by Race. We also published Modeling Income in the Near Term (MINT) projections, MINT fact sheets, and Retirement and Disability Research Consortium working papers, providing updated projections, including by race and ethnicity, to inform agency and academic research. 2) In August 2022, we added race and ethnicity questions to the online SSN application process (OSSNAP) used to obtain an SSN card, resulting in an increase, from August 2022 to August 2023, for voluntary reporting of race information from 46 percent to 52 percent, and of ethnicity information from 54 percent to 59 percent. 3) In FY 2023, we created the Race and Ethnicity Voluntary Reporting Tracking Dashboard to inform our collection strategies. 4) In June 2023, we provided public information materials in English and Spanish to encourage voluntary reporting of race and ethnicity data during new and replacement SSN card applications in select Social Security Administration (SSA) field offices. 5) In August 2023, we made form SS - 5 (Application for a Social Security Card) instructions available in 15 languages other than English and Spanish in local SSA field offices and Card Centers. The non - English instructions will help applicants with LEP complete the English - <span style="background-color: rgba(93, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="language accessibility">language</span> form SS - 5. 6) In September 2023, we added race and ethnicity questions to the internet SSN replacement application process (iSSNRC) used to obtain a replacement SSN card through the my Social Security (mySSA) portal. </p></article>

<p>For FYs 2018 through 2022, we received over 4.5 million requests through the Telephone Interpreter Services (TIS) for 194 languages.

Our digital marketing tactics generated 1.81 million referrals from our SSI website to the online SSI Protective Filing tool, yielding 345,000 SSI applications through September 3, 2023. The tool allows individuals and third - party helpers to establish a protective filing 10 online and request an appointment to file for benefits. b. Our marketing generated more than 1.9 billion impressions across all tactics and over 2.7 million website visits. C. Through September 29, 2023, we exceeded our APG target for SSI applications in underserved communities relative to the 2021 baseline by receiving nearly 135,000 applications. We were about one percent short of the nationwide SSI application target of increasing applications by 15 percent relative to the 2021 baseline, receiving about 1.74 million applications. d. We added a paper survey to 300,000 of the 2.1 million mailers and added an online survey for those who visited our English and Spanish vanity URL, or custom shortened link. We received 2,575 responses with as many as 81 percent of the respondents saying the information was either " " very helpful " " or " " helpful " ", among other key findings. 2) In FY 2023, we hosted several Outreach to Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Kids Subgroup Meetings and listening sessions with advocates to gain a better understanding of external experiences related to SSI for children, and to hear fresh ideas on how to reach parents and caregivers. 3) In FY 2023, we mailed a notice to more than 323,000 SSI recipients between the ages of 14 and 17 (transition - aged youth) and their adult representatives, to provide more information about the changes that happen with SSI payments when youth turn age 18. 11 SSI " " Basic Needs " " Campaign Marketing Tactics The campaign's digital tactics included Search Engine Marketing, social media, online display ads, YouTube video ads, and an updated SSI webpage. Non - digital tactics included TV and radio public service announcements, radio ads, direct mail to 2.1 million households in underserved communities, convenience store posters, and drugstore bag inserts. 4) On October 4, 2022, we established the Office of Native American Partnerships, and published an accompanying press release. The office's mission is to elevate and centralize efforts to administer comprehensive programs and policies related to American Indians and Alaska Natives. The office also works to enhance our relationship with Tribes and serves as the primary point of contact on Tribal affairs. 5) In February 2023, we <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 185, 255, 0.3)" title="Customer Service">streamlined</span> the Continuing Disability Review Report to make it easier to complete, by: a. Shortening form SSA - 454, Continuing Disability Review, from 15 to 12 pages, Simplified the questions, Removed free format narrative responses, and Removed the requirement for specific dates for medical sources. b. Creating an internet version (iCDR / i454) of the form. </p></article>

The OT's mission is to facilitate the most critical business enhancements that serve the public and support our frontline employees. The mission is underpinned by CX to ensure equitable access to SSA's programs. The OT is undertaking the SSI simplification equity strategy and plans to include accessibility expertise to ensure greater disability equity in our initiatives. 7) On August 21, 2023, we removed the signature requirement for all versions of form SSA - 455, Continuing Disability Review, making it less burdensome for the public to complete and submit. 8) In September 2023, we implemented the new Upload Documents portal. This portal allows respondents to submit evidence and some SSA forms electronically through an Internet portal. In addition, we also are allowing eSignature of some forms through the Upload Documents portal. This new portal reduces the need for respondents to call or travel to a field office to submit forms or evidence. </p></article>

<p>The cornerstone of equity in foreign policy is direct action through the Department's Equity Principals who traveled the world to listen to and amplify the voices of marginalized populations. The Department produces numerous public reports that have strengthened their specific focus on equity, such as Human Rights Report, Trafficking in Persons Report, International Religious Freedom Report, and several equity - related Congressional reports. The Department also established its first Equity Agency Priority Goal (APG), outlined in the 2022 Plan, to advance equity in U.S. foreign policies, programs, and processes. As an example of how the APG drove significant organizational change by identifying outcomes and measuring results, the United States negotiated more than 50 United Nations outcome and / or consensus documents that expanded inclusive <span style="background-color: rgba(93, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="language accessibility">language</span> of historically marginalized and underserved groups.

In so doing, we will safeguard democratic principles, inclusive security, and prosperity. We will lead with diplomacy that is rooted in America's most cherished democratic values: upholding and defending universal human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as dignity for all, championing opportunity for all, and respecting the rule of law.

<p>There is overwhelming quantitative evidence that women and girls ' empowerment and gender equality are associated with peace and stability in society. Promoting gender equality demonstrates American values of democracy, respect for human rights, and inclusivity and improves the effectiveness of U.S. foreign policy. Democracy, a governing system based on the will and consent of the governed, is founded on institutions that are <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="accountability">accountable</span> to all citizens, adherence to the rule of law, and respect for all individuals ' human rights, which requires that women and girls are safe and empowered. Both democracy and gender equality, longstanding U.S. values, are effective and successful in delivering long - term stability and prosperity. Despite decades of progress and long - standing multilateral instruments on advancing the rights and empowerment of women and girls, gains in gender equality are stalled or regressing around the world. The United Nations estimates that, at the current rate, it will take an estimated 286 years to close gaps in legal protection and remove discriminatory laws; 140 years for women to be represented equally in positions of power and leadership in the workplace; and 300 years to end child, early, and forced marriage. </p></article>

<p>These are <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 185, 0.3)" title="community engagement">meaningful</span> milestones that demonstrate Treasury's commitment to bolstering economic opportunity across the country. Our economic recovery from the pandemic was just the beginning of this work. Treasury is now deeply engaged in efforts to foster inclusive, equitable growth through government investments that unleash the economic potential of historically marginalized and under - resourced people and places. For instance, Treasury is delivering on President Biden's goal of closing the digital divide. In the rural South and dense urban areas alike, Black Americans are about twice as likely as their white counterparts to lack high - speed internet access. Treasury has awarded over $ 8 billion for broadband projects to connect millions of Americans across the country to high - speed internet. As another example, as of September 2023, Treasury has approved 54 out of 56 state and territory applications for SSBCI, representing plans totaling over $ 8 billion to support the boom in small business creation. </p></article>

<p>Treasury is also taking concerted steps to ensure that the economic opportunities created by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the transition to the clean energy economy are shared by all Americans, including communities of color, rural areas, and communities harmed by pollution. For example, the investment tax credit for solar and wind projects includes a substantial bonus for facilities built in low - income communities. According to outside estimates, the IRA will support new clean energy jobs, as well as incentivize the use of registered apprenticeships and the payment of prevailing wages to strengthen America's energy and economic security. And Internal Revenue Service (IRS) transformation will improve <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 185, 255, 0.3)" title="Customer Service">customer</span> service, help taxpayers access credits and expenditures that enhance financial security, and promote fairer tax enforcement, all while strengthening the revenue generation that supports the essential work of government. </p></article>

<p>2022 Equity Action Plan Update (pursuant to EO 13985): Since the first Equity Action Plan launched in April 2022, Treasury has made significant progress toward fostering an equitable recovery from the pandemic; ensuring the flow of mission - driven capital to those who need it most; improving the tax system to make it easier for all Americans to receive the benefits for which they are eligible; reforming debt collection practices to reduce burdens on underserved communities; and expanding opportunity for small businesses through procurement and contracting. For instance, Treasury's Office of Procurement created an Equity Heat Map to identify upcoming opportunities more easily for small, socioeconomically disadvantaged, or underserved businesses to compete for contracts. Treasury researchers developed a method for imputing race and ethnicity data in tax data, which has enabled multiple ongoing and completed studies, including one on audit disparities between Black and non - Black taxpayers and one on the distribution of tax expenditures by race and ethnicity.

<p>Underserved small businesses often lack the access to capital they need to expand and grow the products and services they provide, often within the underserved communities they support. Businesses often need financial documentation, a business plan, accounting capacity, or a legal structure to apply for and receive commercial loans. These requirements are often beyond the capacity of underserved small businesses. Underserved communities lack financing for neighborhood essentials, such as schools, childcare, housing, and health - care clinics. As noted by the Urban Institute, CDFIs struggle to meet all needs for community development. While they can support some development needs, they look for additional resources to support the overall community ecosystem. CDFIs and MDIs that serve under - resourced stakeholders lack access to flexible capital to pass along to the communities they serve to not only help businesses grow but to also provide much needed services to their communities.

<p>Treasury has established the Equity Hub within the Office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility to lead research and policy analysis that supports the Department in its effort to drive toward a more fair and equitable economy. In recognition of the sovereignty of, and our partnership with, Tribal Nations, Treasury's Office of Tribal and Native Affairs is responsible for advising on departmental issues related to Tribal governments and Native communities, including the administration of $ 30 billion in direct Tribal set - asides to the benefit of over 2.5 million Tribal citizens. The Office also conducts consultations with Tribes and coordinates outreach. As of June 2023, the Office has hosted over 45 formal consultations and 700 Tribal <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 185, 0.3)" title="community engagement">engagement</span> sessions. Treasury has made significant efforts to engage with stakeholders and the public on topics related to equity. For instance, in December 2022, the Department held the first TACRE meeting, with subsequent meetings in March, June, and September 2023.

The Department collaborated with 12 national Hispanic and Latino organizations to host the first Treasury Department summit on investing in the economic future of the Latino community in June 2023 to elevate challenges and opportunities facing that community. The Latino Economic Summit brought together nearly 100 leaders from the private, non - profit, and government sectors to identify opportunities to unleash the potential of the Latino community and the entire economy.

<p>Under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, Treasury supported the economic recovery for communities and individuals impacted by COVID - 19 through the ARP. For example, the Department and the CDFI Fund have deployed historic amounts of capital to CDFIs and MDIs - institutions that have a demonstrated track record of reaching financially underserved borrowers. In addition, through the ECIP, Treasury has made close to $ 8.4 billion in investments in 170 community financial institutions, in addition to over $ 1.73 billion in grants through the CDFI ERP, and a historic $ 226 million investment in 68 Puerto Rican cooperativas, or cooperative community financial institutions. New ECIP reporting data made available in October 2023, reflecting lending in the final six months of 2022, showed that ECIP lenders originated a total of approximately $ 26 billion in loans, of which approximately 75 % went to low - and moderate - income borrowers, borrowers in rural communities and other categories of qualified lending. Approximately one third of their total originations, $ 8.6 billion, were " " deep impact " " loans, made to the hardest - to - serve borrowers, including those that are low - income, residents on Tribal lands and in US Territories and owners of very small businesses. Treasury leveraged the ERA program to create the first - ever nationwide infrastructure to prevent eviction, with more than 12.3 million household payments to families at risk of eviction as of June 30, 2023. This program has been particularly effective at reaching low - income and / or traditionally underserved renters, including Black and women - headed households. By reimagining how the IRS serves families, the IRS delivered half of the expanded Child Tax Credit (CTC) via monthly payments from July to December 2021. Treasury also collaborated with Code for America, a non - governmental non - profit, to build a <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 185, 255, 0.3)" title="Customer Service">streamlined</span>, mobile - friendly portal in English and Spanish to make it easier for families to access the expanded CTC. New Census data released in 2022 showed that the expanded CTC was the leading driver behind a 46 percent decline in child poverty in 2021 - cutting the annual child poverty rate to its lowest - ever recorded level including record lows in Black, Hispanic, Native American, Asian, and white child poverty. Additionally, the permanent lifting of restrictions that prevented some Puerto Rican families from receiving the CTC led to 200,000 more Puerto Rican families receiving the credit when they filed taxes in 2022 compared to the year prior. As of September 2023, Treasury has approved 54 out of 56 state and territory applications for SSBCI Capital Programs totaling over $ 8.2 billion in allocations, and has announced approvals of up to $ 73 million corresponding to applications representing 39 Tribes.

Scale up implementation of Inclusive Development Assessments (IDAs). An IDA is an assessment tool that guides in - country interviews and research to help identify in a particular country those populations that are marginalized and excluded from access to public services such as health, education, transportation, and or economic opportunities. Through the IDA we are able to analyze the country's social, economic, political, and cultural factors that lead to marginalization, determine access to assets, resources, opportunities, and services. IDA concludes with a summary of the context and provides specific recommendations for USAID to increase inclusion of marginalized groups in their development programmes and policies. Analyze up to 10 Performance Plan and Report (PPR) Key Issue Narratives and identify new opportunities for advancing racial and ethnic equity and support for underserved communities in programming.

<p>a) 2022 Equity Action Plan Update (pursuant to EO 13985) Since the launch of WorkwithUSAID.gov in November 2021, USAID has approved more than 4,700 partner profiles in the platform's Partner Directory, and of those partners, more than 1,600 have completed the pre - <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 185, 0.3)" title="community engagement">engagement</span> assessment.

The team has translated the top 20 resources on the platform into French, Spanish, and Arabic for use in host countries where USAID works. These resources are helping to bridge the gap for local entities that are not fluent in English as USAID continues to develop additional documentation in foreign languages. USAID's Inclusive Development e - learning module is now mandatory for all of the workforce. As of June 2023, 86 percent (11,200 out of approximately 13,000) of USAID's workforce have received the training on Inclusive Development. USAID held three external and three internal consultations with stakeholders, delivered two informational webinars for USAID <span style="background-color: rgba(232, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Staff Experience">staff</span>, held consultations with program participants across USAID Missions and briefed all Bureaus and Independent Offices (B / IOs) on the development of the ' Know Your Protections ' (KYP) document (formerly known as the ' Beneficiaries Bill of Rights ' - BBoR). This document aims to summarize and highlight existing protections for USAID program participants, making them accessible and easily understandable. The document has been revised and is currently undergoing clearance at the agency. USAID developed the Social, Economic, and Environmental <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="accountability">Accountability</span> Mechanism (SEE - AM), which advances program participant protections. The mechanism provides a channel for program participants and affected communities to inform the Agency of harm experienced in relation to USAID's programs and projects overseas.

Exposure to these best practices and technical guidance will encourage the adoption of quality equity programs on a broader scale. USAID Missions and Bureaus are now required to report on a new key issue narrative in their annual reports capturing racial and ethnic equity.

USAID released the Agency's highest level policy document, the Policy Framework, in March 2023. The Policy Framework emphasizes a commitment to embed DEIA principles across our programs, people, processes, policies, and practices so that development gains are more locally - led and benefit people of all backgrounds and identities. b) <span style="background-color: rgba(93, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="climate">Environmental Justice</span> Scorecard (pursuant to section 223 of EO 14008) USAID is not required to complete the <span style="background-color: rgba(93, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="climate">Environmental Justice</span> Scorecard.

<p>June 2023, USDA announced a $ 262.5 million investment to support 33 projects, across U.S. institutions of higher education, designed to train the next generation of diverse agricultural professionals. The projects are led by 1890 land - grant institutions (historically Black land - grant universities), 1994 land - grant institutions (tribal colleges and universities), Alaska native - serving institutions and native Hawaiian - serving institutions, Hispanic - serving institutions, and institutions of higher education located in the Insular Areas. Most projects involve collaboration with other minority - serving institutions and a myriad of other partners, including other academic institutions, non - profit and private - sector organizations, and state and USDA agencies. Resourced by the ARPA, as amended by the IRA, the From Learning to Leading: Cultivating the Next Generation of Diverse Food and Agriculture Professionals (NextGen) Program is enabling minority - serving institutions to engage, recruit, retain, train, and support students to build and sustain the next generation of the food, agriculture, natural resources, and human sciences workforce, including the future USDA workforce. It is administered by NIFA, which is also partnering with The Extension Foundation to increase the capacity of the funded institutions. The Extension Foundation will provide free grant proposal development as well as technical assistance to all grantees to support project management. Additionally, NIFA is <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 46, 0.3)" title="collaboration">working with</span> the Intercultural Development Research Association (IDRA) to determine the overall effectiveness of the NextGen program; IDRA will track program outcomes, report impact, and <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="accountability">evaluate</span> individual and program - wide activities.

<p>Increasing access to NAP. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) has long heard about the challenges underserved farmers have faced in navigating the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP). In January 2023, FSA announced program updates to reduce the paperwork burden on these producers to access free basic NAP coverage with a NAP service - fee waiver. Specifically, the requirement for a separate application for coverage prior to the loss event was eliminated for anyone already certified as an underserved producer - that is, for beginning, veteran, limited resource, women, or minority farmers. This eliminated otherwise annual application requirements; <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 185, 0.3)" title="community engagement">participation</span> instead requires only loss notifications and applications for payment. The result has been substantial growth in producer <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 185, 0.3)" title="community engagement">participation</span>. </p></article>

Some hurdles and harmful policies - for example, the allocation of safety net programs by crop and historical plantings " " base acres " " or inflexible limits or life - time ineligibility for farm loans - are enshrined in statute and cannot be remedied through administrative action. As these <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 139, 0, 0.3)" title="barriers">barriers</span> are identified, USDA will continue to explore opportunities to address them legislatively. Eight such legislative proposals were included for farm loans in the President's FY 2024 Budget. C.

<p>D. USDA will create new, more, and better market opportunities for producers, which creates a fairer playing field for small - and mid - size farmers. USDA is investing in developing new market opportunities and fairer markets SO that producers have more power in the marketplace and greater opportunities to generate income and make a living in agriculture. Ongoing efforts involve investments in new market opportunities, amelioration of supply chain bottlenecks, and improvements in fair competition. E. USDA will expand reach to all producers by leveraging partnerships with trusted technical advisors. Across the Department - FSA, NRCS, RMA, NIFA, and the Office of Partnerships and Public <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 185, 0.3)" title="community engagement">Engagement</span> (OPPE) - USDA will continue and expand grant and cooperative agreement programs that support delivery of conservation assistance, risk management education, farming and production - related education, and technical assistance to underserved farmers (including beginning, limited resource, socially disadvantaged, and veteran farmers). F. USDA will target direct assistance and technical support based on degree of need. USDA is implementing support for support for underserved producers; progressive payment factoring; and whole - farm revenue approaches particularly suited to smaller operations. Where USDA has discretion, as in the ad - hoc disaster programs, the Department has been pursuing these strategies administratively. Other permanent programs would need legislative action; USDA is providing technical assistance to Congress on these areas. G. USDA will institutionalize access for broader stakeholder viewpoints. USDA is making a concerted effort to bring new voices to the table and to expand its stakeholder base. To that end, a large group of both longstanding and new formal committees are providing valuable input, including: the USDA Equity Commission; NRCS state technical committees; FSA County Committees, including urban county committees; and other new and continuing Federal Advisory Committees (Urban Agriculture, Tribal, Minority Farmers, New and Beginning Farmers). </p></article>

<p>VA operates a large and complex acquisition program. This inherently favors firms who already understand the program or have the resources necessary to learn it. The perceived difficulty of learning the system may act as a <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 139, 0, 0.3)" title="barriers">barrier</span> to new entrants and disadvantaged businesses with limited resources. Overcoming this information gap will be essential to the success of underserved firms. Reducing costs and administrative burdens are in tension with the need for additional contracts. Also, VA's mission and statutory mandate require VA to be Veterans First in all efforts surrounding procurement. The Veterans First statutory mandate is implemented through the VA Rule of Two. The statute requires the Department to set - aside contracts first for Service - Disabled Veteran - owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) and Veteran - owned Small Businesses (VOSB) before other socio - economic categories, after it is determined that the Veteran firm can meet all other required acquisition regulatory and legislative criteria. Thus, by law, WOSB, HUBZone and SDB companies not owned by Veterans are considered only after a determination is made that an SDVOSB or VOSB set - aside is unfeasible. These competing objectives can pose a <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 139, 0, 0.3)" title="barriers">barrier</span> if the VA <span style="background-color: rgba(232, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Staff Experience">staff</span> is not properly trained to follow established acquisition regulatory guidance and other legislative requirements. </p></article>

<p>VA augmented its PACT Act Performance Dashboard to include a quarterly demographic supplement that includes demographics analyses for key metrics beginning with gender, race / ethnicity and age, that will provide insights to help ensure VA's implementation of the law serves all Veterans. In October 2021, VA enhanced the quarterly VA - Wide Trust Survey to capture voluntary, self - reported expanded demographic options for race, ethnicity, gender identity and sexual orientation to identify trust scores for underserved populations. These metrics are reported each quarter as part of VA's I * DEA agency priority goal (APG) for the FY 2022 - 2023 cycle and from quarter 1 of FY 2022 through quarter 3 of FY 2023, statistically significant increases in trust occurred across 10 of the 26 enhanced demographic domains. When comparing quarter 3 of FY 2022 trust scores with quarter 3 of FY 2023 trust scores, VA saw statistically significant increases across 19 of the 26 domains. See Appendix, VA - Wide Trust Scores: I * DEA APG, quarter 1 of FY 2022 through quarter 3 of FY 2023.
