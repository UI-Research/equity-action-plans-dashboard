<p>(1) Reduce barriers to citizenship and naturalization through continued evaluation of programs, policies, and outreach opportunities. There is a significant gap between the annual naturalization rate and the annual size of the population eligible to naturalize. Commonly cited barriers to naturalization include: a lack of understanding about the naturalization process; a real or perceived inability to meet the English language requirement that is part of the naturalization process; a lack of ability to pay application fees; and a lack of understanding about reduced fees and fee waiver options. To address these barriers, USCIS will strengthen efforts to promote naturalization through citizenship education and outreach, capacity building efforts, and more streamlined naturalization application services. (2) Promote equitable use of <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="AI">AI</span> technology across the Department through the development and application of new guidance as well as intra - agency coordination. With increased use of <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="AI">AI</span> in carrying out DHS's homeland security mission, members of underserved communities may face disproportionate or disparate impacts, such as additional scrutiny or denial of benefits based on the potential for algorithms to operate in a manner that exhibits inappropriate biases in violation of law and DHS policy.

<p>Naturalization applications and naturalizations have risen over time, but each year, only about 10 percent of eligible individuals naturalize. This trend has persisted for decades. Commonly cited barriers to naturalization include a lack of understanding about the naturalization process, a real or perceived inability to meet the English language requirement that is part of the naturalization process, a belief that the civics test is too difficult, a lack of time to prepare for the naturalization test and interview, a lack of ability to pay application fees, and a lack of understanding about reduced fees and fee waiver options. 3 About 3.5 percent of all Form N - 400s (Applications for Naturalization) are currently accompanied by at least one Form N - 648 (Medical Certification for Disability Exception). The public has commented on the limited list of medical professionals who are eligible to certify Form N - 648.

<p>On January 11, 2023, USCIS hosted a national listening session on the Proposed Rule to Adjust Certain Immigration Fees. USCIS provided an overview of the proposed rule and reviewed how to submit formal comments. On May 16, 2023, USCIS participated in an engagement hosted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to educate USDA employees about " " Equity and Nutrition Security Among Eligible Immigrant Families. " " During the engagement USCIS educated USDA staff about the barriers and challenges facing immigrant families in accessing federal programs and highlighted the role USCIS plays through outreach and engagements to ensure stakeholders are well informed about the Final Public Charge Rule. USCIS held stakeholder engagements on January 12, March 3, April 28, and May 31, 2023, to address questions and gather feedback on the naturalization test redesign initiative. For FY 2023, USCIS scheduled and conducted in - person Adult Citizenship Education Training in areas where there are large numbers of LPRs who are eligible to naturalize and areas that are underserved. USCIS will continue to engage with the public, including members of underserved communities; relevant stakeholders; state and local government; and other federal agencies to seek input on ways to further advance equity in applying for naturalization. As part of this effort, USCIS will utilize its expanded cadre of citizenship ambassadors to share information about the naturalization process and how to access information and support. Further, CRCL, in collaboration with USCIS / NWG, will periodically disseminate messaging regarding citizenship and naturalization initiatives to CRCL's network of community stakeholders through the GovDelivery system and monthly CRCL newsletter with an audience of over 10,000 members of the public. Additionally, CRCL, in collaboration with USCIS / NWG, will host a series of Naturalization Test Redesign Information and Listening Sessions with CRCL's network of community stakeholders.

<p>1. Applying for Naturalization. USCIS began a comprehensive review of policies, regulations, forms, and operations to identify barriers that may impede access to naturalization by underserved communities and is undertaking efforts to reduce or eliminate those barriers. In October 2022, USCIS updated Form N - 648 (Medical Certification for Disability Exceptions) and related Policy Manual guidance. Applicants for naturalization with physical or developmental disability or mental impairments may request an exception to the English and civics testing requirements for naturalization. This form and Policy Manual update streamline the process for applicants to claim and substantiate a disability by eliminating unnecessary and duplicative questions. In March 2023, USCIS updated Policy Manual guidance to allow individuals requesting immigration benefits to self - select their <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">gender</span> marker (" " Male " " or " " Female " ") without the need to provide proof of their <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">gender</span> identity or to match the <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">gender</span> listed on their supporting documentation. This update reflects an important step toward reducing administrative burdens on applicants and increasing accessibility to immigration benefits and services. 2. Accessing Humanitarian Protection During Immigration Processing. DHS improved access to humanitarian protection during immigration processing by addressing language and disability access gaps and enhancing access to legal information and resources. In July 2022, USCIS issued new language access guidance to ensure that LEP individuals seeking asylum who cannot be interviewed in the credible fear screening process are placed into removal proceedings where an immigration judge can apply appropriate language access safeguards as that individual seeks relief. The USCIS Language Services Branch (LSB) has prioritized reaching the most vulnerable populations, including victims of trafficking, in their languages and in a culturally appropriate manner. This work, which spanned two fiscal years and involved multiple language specialists, resulted in approximately 1,000 pages of translation. Additionally, in close collaboration with the Asylum Division and the </p></article>

<p>Benefit applicants, both overseas and domestic, sometimes have difficulty attending USCIS appointments when the distance needed to travel is long. There are barriers related to transportation, health and safety, and finances. In FY 2023, USCIS's Refugee, Asylum, and International Operations (RAIO) began increasing the use of video technology to conduct I - 589 asylum interviews domestically, and I - 590 refugee interviews internationally, SO that applicants living in remote locations will not have to wait SO long or travel SO far. USCIS is currently drafting a proposed rule that would codify RAIO's flexibility to conduct remote interviews with refugee applicants abroad. In March 2023, USCIS published an extension to the Asylum Interpreter Temporary Final Rule (TFR) that allowed USCIS to provide telephonic interpreters for asylum applicants who speak one of 47 listed languages through September 12, 2023. Telephonic interpreters can also be connected to video interviews SO that remote interviews can be completed. The TFR temporarily reduced barriers for asylum applicants to attend and complete their interviews. There is a significant backlog of pending petitions for U nonimmigrant status due, in part, to the annual statutory cap limiting approvals to 10,000 principal petitions per fiscal year. As this backlog of over 250,000 filings are solely filed via paper and postal mail, USCIS is considering ways to leverage technology to improve processing to provide Employment Authorization Documents and deferred action for U petitioners and their derivatives with pending filings. As noted in the U.S. National Plan to End <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">Gender</span> - Based Violence, immigrant survivors face increased barriers to economic stability. They often encounter delayed processing times when applying for special immigration remedies for GBV victims that were established through VAWA and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, such as the VAWA self - petition, the U nonimmigrant status for eligible victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and qualifying eligible crimes, and the T nonimmigrant status for eligible victims of a severe form of trafficking in persons. Delays in access to work authorization and public benefits for which an individual is potentially eligible, such as housing assistance or health care, can increase vulnerabilities to abuse and undermine recovery and healing. For refugees living in many parts of the world to access the US Refugee Admissions Program, they need to be interviewed and processed by USCIS while they are overseas, which presents many logistical and travel challenges for both the refugees and USCIS staff. When USCIS has no permanent presence in a geographic area, processing occurs when USCIS has the staff to make several international trips to complete different processing steps, thereby increasing the processing time. There are numerous steps involved in processing benefits for refugee populations, such as medical exams, refugee interviews, finalization of the decision, and assurances for placement with domestic resettlement agencies. These steps typically take place sequentially and may take a long time in between steps. Noncitizen workers are particularly vulnerable to workplace abuses including unpaid wages, discrimination, health and safety violations, and reprisals for seeking to improve working conditions. In addition, noncitizen workers are often afraid to report violations to labor enforcement agencies or participate in labor standards investigations for fear of immigration - related retaliation or threats of deportation by their employers. </p></article>

<p>Reduce barriers to humanitarian benefits by leveraging technology, increasing access, enhancing process efficiencies, and seeking opportunities to reduce fees. Strengthen resources for non - detained noncitizens released on an alternative to detention by building on existing case management programs, like the Case Management Pilot Program, which provides case management, legal information and screening, trafficking screening, and connection to a range of social services, including pro se counsel, to noncitizens on ATD. As enumerated in DHS's National Action Plan to implement the <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">Gender</span> Policy Council Strategy, USCIS and ICE will work to expand access to T and U nonimmigrant statuses and VAWA protections. These benefits offer critical protection for many of our most vulnerable noncitizens - those who have been victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons and other specified crimes, and those who are victims of battery or extreme cruelty by an abusive spouse or other family member. All three benefits are crucial in stabilizing victims by providing a potential pathway to lawful permanent residence. The Department will explore how to prevent instances of domestic abuse, <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">gender</span> - based violence, human trafficking, and other criminal activity by raising awareness of and expanding access to potentially eligible noncitizens, including women of color, who may be particularly vulnerable. USCIS leads this effort and has set goals to guide its backlog - reduction efforts.

<p>6. Airport Screening. In furtherance of TSA's mission to protect the Nation's transportation systems and facilitate lawful travel, TSA has enhanced and standardized training for its screening officers and has improved its screening technology capabilities to reduce the possibility of bias against travelers and increase safety. TSA deployed new Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) software for screening systems at airports across the country. This update eliminates the need for Transportation Security Officers to determine a passenger's <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">gender</span> prior to AIT screening and is projected to reduce the instances of enhanced screening for transgender persons and members of other underserved communities. TSA has held multiple community engagements to enhance communication with the traveling public and increase awareness of security procedures. 7. Trusted Traveler Programs. DHS has taken steps to advance equity in its Trusted Traveler Programs. TSA updated the PreCheck application process by allowing individuals to select their <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">gender</span> marker based on self - attestation, regardless of sex assigned at birth.

Public Assistance. FEMA has advanced equity as a foundation for public assistance. In August 2022, FEMA's Office for Public Assistance released the Operational Draft of the Public Assistance Program Delivery Guide, which included considerations for FEMA recipients and applicants to conduct response and recovery efforts in an equitable manner. The Guide includes a performance metric for the prioritization of communities rated as highly socially vulnerable, including underserved <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">rural</span> areas. From April 2021 through August 2022, FEMA's Office for Equal Rights worked with the Office for Public Assistance on its mission to ensure an equitable response to the COVID - 19 pandemic. FEMA established the Civil Rights Advisory Group as part of the agency's commitment to the COVID - 19 vaccination mission amid the ongoing battle against the pandemic. The advisory group's mission is to evaluate the policies, practices, strategies, and plans in place to ensure equity in vaccine access and administration. 9. Achieving Equitable Outcomes for Disaster Survivors. FEMA continues to advance equitable outcomes for disaster survivors. FEMA is working to identify and include considerations for traditionally underserved or marginalized communities in the forms, processes, and online Grants Portal system that the agency uses to support applicants. </p></article>

<p>FEMA is redeveloping the way it collects, documents, and processes information from applicants to be less burdensome, more effective, and more equitable in the distribution of Public Assistance. Moving forward, FEMA will work to clarify the recipient's legal responsibility and to structure a more comprehensive reporting process SO that recipients and subrecipients clearly understand their obligations to develop and report on their strategies for equitable response and recovery. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) selected Recovering from a Disaster as a Life Experience Project in 2022. Discovery work was completed to inform how FEMA could create an equitable and less frustrating experience to survivors while they are enduring trauma. Based on recommendations made from the discovery work, the General Services Administration is currently partnering with FEMA to <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Analyze">measure</span> end - to - end burden placed on natural disaster survivors. 10. Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP). NSGP provides funding for physical security enhancements to nonprofit organizations, including houses of worship, that are at high risk of terrorist attack. FEMA has improved equitable access to NSGP funding by improving participation from nonprofit organizations serving underserved communities and embedding equity considerations in the grant review process. FEMA continues to engage in robust outreach and engagement efforts throughout the NSGP lifecycle to ensure that nonprofit organizations have the information they need to apply. In FY 2022, NSGP held 82 events, including webinars, with over 18,039 unique participants to increase understanding of the application process and eligibility for subrecipients. In June 2023, FEMA published an informative video about applying to the NSGP, available both on YouTube.com and FEMA.gov. FEMA has collaborated with other federal and nonprofit partners to further amplify this engagement and messaging, including the DHS Center for Faith - Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, Department of Justice (DOJ) Community Relations Service, religious and cultural organizations, HBCUs, and Minority Serving Institutions. In FY 2023, FEMA advanced considerations of equity in awarding NSGP grant funding by adding up to 15 additional points to the scores of organizations that demonstrate how they serve an underserved community or population or that are located within an underserved community. Additionally, applicants who had never received NSGP funding had 15 points added to their project score (a scoring metric continued from FY 2022). </p></article>

<p>One of the cornerstones of DHS's approach to equity is a strong commitment to stakeholder and community engagement - to understand concerns about barriers faced by members of underserved communities in DHS's programs and to assess the effectiveness of DHS's efforts to address those barriers. Over the past year, DHS hosted engagements specific to the areas of focus in this plan. For example, in August 2022, the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) led a listening session to hear directly from Arab, Middle Eastern, Muslim, and South Asian (AMEMSA) faith - based and community leaders regarding civil rights and civil liberties concerns. The discussion focused on DHS policies and practices, particularly with respect to screening and redress. In February 2023, the Office of Partnership and Engagement (OPE) held a listening session with diverse faith leaders in Dearborn, Michigan to better understand the threat landscape and share DHS information and resources. In June 2023, CRCL led a listening session regarding DHS's use of <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="AI">artificial intelligence</span> (<span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="AI">AI</span>) to understand stakeholders ' concerns about disparate </p></article>

<p>Geographic income inequality has risen more than 40 percent between 1980 and 2021. The richest places are pulling away, and many others - especially smaller towns and <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">rural</span> areas - have fallen further behind. Rising geographic inequality suggests that economic opportunities are becoming less evenly distributed across the country and such geographic inequality risks reducing households ' ability to move to desired locations. This could concentrate economic and social challenges in certain places, or contribute to political polarization. Places with higher incomes in 1980 tended to have faster income growth between 1980 and 2021, contributing to widening geographic inequality and little change in the income ranking of places. In recent decades, faster - growing, higher - paying sectors have clustered in the same places over time, leading to increased geographic inequality. Additionally, the faster - growing, higher - paying sectors, such as tech, finance, and professional services, have become a growing share of the economy and pay high wages. </p></article>

Participants represented various federal agencies involved in capital formation issues and addressing solutions to access to capital issues for MBEs. The discussion focused on the status of issues and programs relating to capital formation from the government's perspective and solutions for addressing these issues. MBDA Business Centers. The MBDA has entered into memoranda of agreement with Bilateral Infrastructure Law funded agencies, including the Department of Transportation and Department of Energy, designed to maximize the inclusion and growth of MBEs in federal investments, contracts, resources, and administration priorities around high - growth industries. The three top initiatives will include a National Equity Tour, Technical Assistance / Business Advisory Services, and MBE Contract Matching. These collaborations aim to close the gap in federal contracting disparity and ensure that MBEs have an equitable opportunity to participate in and benefit from federal contract opportunities. EDA's Build to Scale. EDA works with SSTI, a national nonprofit organization focused on STEM initiatives offers information and services that are needed to succeed in today's innovation economy. SSTI will host a Community of Practice (CoP) focused on technology - based economic development, through which EDA supports members of the CoP, including B2S recipients, and receives feedback on the B2S program. Outside of SSTI, EDA engages with diverse audiences at numerous conferences, webinars, and annual convenings. Lastly, EDA solicits public input on the design and implementation of the B2S program through its Customer Experience Survey. EDA incorporates this program delivery feedback in future grant competitions. USPTO's Council for Inclusive Innovation. The USPTO has been conducting in - person and virtual outreach to inventors, attorneys, and law schools to increase awareness and participation in pro bono programs and legal services programs through, for example, its " " Pathways " " events for current and aspiring entrepreneurs. These networking events connect attendees with IP protection and commercialization information and resources. In addition, the Under Secretary has sent letters to law schools throughout the country inviting them to join the USPTO Law School Clinic Certification Program.

The Department of Labor's (Labor) Employment and Earnings by Occupation <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> showed that the number of women working in the construction industry at only 10 percent or 1.2 million women as of 2020. Secretary Raimondo announced a public goal to double the number of women working in the construction industry over the next ten years. To achieve this goal, the Department is promoting the goal through large implementation programs, working with other agencies to do the same, and highlighting commitments from Labor and the private sector to launch complementary efforts. In July 2023, the Secretary hired a Senior Advisor for Women in Construction to oversee this initiative. Through the Internet for All program, Commerce will promote increased outreach to recruit women in broadband construction. NTIA's BEAD program requires states and territories to develop workforce plans that include strategies to ensure the job opportunities created will be available to a diverse pool of workers, including women and people of color. Through the CHIPS NOFO for commercial facilities, applicants are asked to describe how they will recruit, hire, and retain a diverse and skilled construction workforce, including efforts to include women and other economically disadvantaged individuals in the construction industry. Additionally, the CHIPS NOFO for commercial fabrication facilities requires applicants requesting over $ 150 million in direct funding to provide a plan for access to child care for facility and construction workers. This will expand access to training opportunities and enable workers to fully participate in these high - quality, good - paying jobs. </p></article>

Address harmful biases throughout the <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="AI">AI</span> system lifecycle. In May, NIST and NSF launched the Institute for Trustworthy Al in Law and Society (TRAILS), a partnership between the University of Maryland, George Washington, and Morgan State University. NIST and NSF will invest $ 20 million over five years for TRAILS to focus on how ethics and human rights can drive Al development and governance. Importantly, a key pillar of TRAILS will be input and feedback from marginalized communities. </p></article>

<p>The most persistent barrier to the establishment, expansion, and growth of minority business enterprises (MBEs) continues to be access to capital. The U.S. Federal Reserve found that more than half of Black - owned businesses were turned down for private bank loans, a rate twice as high as white business owners. A Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies study found that 6 in 10 Black business owners faced challenges obtaining capital. Over a third of Latino business owners faced the same. Business owners of color were more likely to struggle to access startup funding, growth funding, and capital with affordable interest rates. In 2022, in the U.S., only 1.9 percent of venture capital dollars went to all - women teams; less than. 5 percent went to Black and Brown women; only 12 percent of venture capital decision - makers are women. Innovation fueled economic growth in America for the past century, but since the 1970s, innovation (as <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Analyze">measured</span> by fundamental productivity growth) appears to have slowed from an annual increase of 1.9 percent to 0.7 percent. Research shows that innovation in the U.S. could quadruple if women, minorities, and children from low - income families became inventors at the same rate as men from high - income families. According to the USPTO, that increase in inventorship would grow our economy and GDP by an estimated $ 1 trillion. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, fewer than 1 percent of minority - owned businesses export goods or services. For these enterprises, insufficient financial resources often hinder their ability to invest in overseas market exploration, navigate regulatory complexities, and establish international networks. </p></article>

<p>Building innovation: In June 2023, NTIA announced funding allocations for the $ 42.45 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program. BEAD funding will be used to deploy or upgrade broadband networks to ensure everyone in America has access to reliable, affordable, high - speed internet service. Once deployment goals are met, any remaining funding can be used to pursue eligible access, adoption, and equity - related uses. Announced in June and September 2023, NTIA's Middle Mile (MM) program provided nearly a billion dollars in grants across 36 organizations across 40 states and territories to support the construction, improvement, or acquisition of middle - mile infrastructure, reduce the cost of bringing high - speed internet to unserved and underserved communities, and increase the resilience of internet infrastructure. Lastly, the purpose of the Broadband Infrastructure Program (BIP) is to build partnerships between states and internet service providers to expand internet access to areas without service, especially <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">rural</span> areas. With $ 288 million, NTIA awarded 14 recipients, and projects began breaking ground this year. </p></article>

NTIA is implementing the Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program (TBCP), a $ 3 billion program to support governments in bringing high - speed internet service to Tribal lands, including telehealth, distance learning, affordability, and digital inclusion initiatives. Under the first funding phase, $ 1.78 billion was awarded to 191 tribal entities since the program began in 2021. The second funding phase, for approximately $ 980 million, was issued on July 27, 2023. As part of EDA's American Rescue Plan funding, the Indigenous Communities program invested $ 100 million to support the needs of tribal governments and Indigenous communities. This program made 51 awards in 25 states and the Northern Mariana Islands. Grantees estimate that these projects will create or save 2,435 jobs and attract $ 28.7 million in private investment. In April 2023, NOAA's Office of Habitat Conservation (OHC) recommended $ 56.4 million, funded by BIL and IRA, in awards for 25 tribal projects to support tribal - led restoration, resilience, and fish passage projects and an additional 22 subawards totaling nearly $ 13 million in funding was awarded to projects that align with tribal priorities, work with tribal members, or restore habitat on tribal - owned lands. For all unsuccessful tribal applicants, OHC staff also offered the opportunity to meet to help those applicants improve their proposals for future competitions. </p></article>

<p>their meaningful participation in peace negotiations makes it more likely that warring parties will reach sustainable agreements and enhance the effectiveness of peacekeeping efforts. E.O. 13595 emphasizes the importance of promoting women's participation in conflict prevention, management, and resolution, as well as in post - conflict relief and recovery; in advancing peace, national security, economic and social development; and in international cooperation. The Department's implementation of the WPS Act is a key component of how the Department works with partner nation security forces on addressing both the barriers for women's participation in the security sector and the long - and short - term security needs of women and girls when impacted by conflict or crisis. These efforts strengthen partner nations ' ability to apply a critical <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">gender</span> analysis to operations and activities of their own national security forces. </p></article>

The cohort included 17 Tribes, or teams, serving Tribal communities. Each of the 67 winners will receive $ 100,000, in - kind - mentorship services, and eligibility to compete in phase two of the prize to win an additional $ 200,000. One of the winning teams is Sustainable Energy for Galena Alaska, a nonprofit run jointly by the Louden Tribal Council, the Galena City School District, and the City of Galena. See Community Profile: What Energizing <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">Rural</span> Communities Means for Galena, Alaska.

DOE employs a <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">Rural</span> Desk Officer, who actively participates in the network. One component of the RPN is the selection of signature projects in communities that have been identified by the network as priority areas. For example, DOE is the lead for the San Carlos Apache Tribe's solar project, which was awarded $ 4M in FY 2023 year. Upon completion, the project will add 750 kW of solar photovoltaic systems and a 500 - kW Battery Energy Storage System to its diesel generators to serve 36 residential buildings for healthcare workers and five hospital buildings at the San Carlos Apache Healthcare Corporation community.

The funding strengthens Tribal communities by increasing their access to solar power and microgrids, increasing energy security and resilience, and powering unelectrified Tribal buildings. The Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC) plays a critical and unique role in catalyzing investments in America's energy future to support the reshoring, skilling, and scaling of U.S. manufacturing across energy supply chains.

Outcome - based metrics are <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> that show the extent and impact of an organization's, program's, or initiative's activities on its customers or beneficiaries. 5 Outcome - based metrics are different from performance metrics, which track the key activities that lead to outcomes, or output or activity <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span>, which describe the organization's actions. 6 Outcome - based metrics are useful for demonstrating accountability, transparency, and efficacy. 7 The benefits of R & D can have long time horizons and broad applications. In general, technology R & D strategy roadmaps lack sufficient consideration of equity or justice. Current roadmaps emphasize technological advancement of high - performance, high - cost technologies that likely will not be affordable to underserved communities. For example, clean energy and energy efficiency programs (e.g., rooftop solar power, weatherization) are not accessible to some underserved and underrepresented communities, especially where there is a reliance upon technology to communicate and access these programs.

Office of Management, Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) OAM implemented an agency - wide BIL funding opportunity announcement (FOA) template for BIL and IRA actions to further the Administration's goals to advance equity, provide support for disadvantaged communities, and leverage federal resources to achieve these objectives. The FOA template includes a Community Benefits Plan requirement, along with requirements to collect equity and justice - focused <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span>. OAM, the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU), and the National Nuclear Safety Administration are co - leading an Acquisition Forecast Improvement Working Group to establish a centralized, web - based platform capturing all contracting, subcontracting and financial assistance opportunities at DOE and better reach underrepresented businesses in DOE procurement opportunities. ii. Progress on increasing opportunities for new applicants to DOE funding opportunities. Office of Management, OAM OAM implemented a strategy with M & O contractors and major site and facility contractors designed to increase subcontracting opportunities from contractors who employ people who are blind or have significant disabilities (AbilityOne). As a result of this implementation, DOE - wide AbilityOne obligations increased from $ 27.5M in FY 2022 to $ 31.2M in FY 2023, an increase of 13 %. OAM continues to co - lead the Innovative Funding Mechanisms Working Group with the Office of General Counsel, which is exploring innovative mechanisms to increase participation in DOE funding opportunities. The Working Group has focused on Partnership Intermediary Agreements (PIAs) and Other Transactions (OT) Authority as possible pathways to reach underrepresented entities and communities. PIAs are best utilized when traditional contractual mechanisms do not provide adequate outreach with non - traditional contractors and can reduce barriers to entry for such entities. DOE has put a Pilot PIA agreement in place to extend the Department's reach to new entrants and non - traditional partners, as well as small business firms, universities, and non - profit organizations. The agency has awarded one project utilizing the PIA mechanism, and additional projects are in the planning phase. Additionally, the agency has developed an OT guide for DOE program offices to increase the utilization of OT Authorities department wide. The agency anticipates that these interventions will increase contracting opportunities with new entrants and non - traditional partners. OAM undertook an initiative in the Office of Headquarters Procurement Services to utilize market research tools such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise - Wide Procurement Provider Lookup Tool, Small Business </p></article>

<p>Current approaches to awarding DOE procurement opportunities lead to inequitable outcomes among economically disadvantaged groups. The Department of Energy, along with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP), co - sponsored two nation - wide crowdsourcing campaigns, and found that women - owned small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, minority - owned small businesses, veteran - owned small businesses; Tribal - owned and Native American - owned small businesses; and Historically Under - utilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses lack clarity on procurement and subcontracting (and other funding mechanisms) opportunities, processes, and procedures.

Based on these <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> points, DOE will fully exercise its statutory and regulatory authority to expand opportunities for new entrants and small and disadvantaged businesses in DOE procurements (acquisition and financial assistance). </p></article>

" " Examples include: Develop a stakeholder relationship management platform to reduce stakeholder fatigue and help staff across the Department learn about the needs communities identify during engagements and consultations. This will lead to more equitable outcomes by increasing the effectiveness and usefulness of engagements. Provide technical assistance for grant writing and grant writers, which we have learned from listening sessions and public comment is an important tool for reducing the barriers to participating in funding opportunities. Work with on - the - ground partners that can help guide and direct our outreach to communities who need it most. For example, the Office of Native Hawaiian Relations has been working with certain Native Hawaiian Organizations (NHOs) that have facilitated outreach to other NHOs and portions of the community that have not historically applied for or received funding from the Department due to capacity issues or other barriers to participation. This outreach helps inform program design to reach those communities. Use funding provided in the Inflation Reduction Act for outreach regarding permitting environmental reviews and authorizations to perform stakeholder and community engagement, with emphasis on enabling underserved communities to be part of the decision - making process. This will help address a priority learning question in the FY 2022 - 2026 Learning Agenda that inquires how the Department can increase capacity to augment the </p></article>

<p>The DOI provided $ 46 million in funding to Tribal communities to address the unique impacts of climate change in Indigenous communities. This initial funding from President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and FY 2022 appropriations funded projects and initiatives address and strengthen climate resilience and adaptation; ocean and coastal management; community - driven relocation and protect - in - place activities; and internships and youth engagement. The DOI announced $ 8.5 million in grant awards by the Office of Insular Affairs ' Energizing Insular Communities program to support energy initiatives in the U.S. Territories. This award included $ 1 million to the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority for the procurement of hybrid and electric utility fleet vehicles and equipment, and $ 1 million to the American Samoa Medical Center Authority for microgrid, cooling tower, and LED lighting retrofit projects. The Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) modified the evaluation criteria for WaterSMART grants to encourage projects that directly benefit disadvantaged communities and support climate change resiliency. The NPS announced $ 192 million in funding for the LWCF - Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership Program (ORLP), which enables urban, disadvantaged communities to (1) create new outdoor recreation spaces, (2) reinvigorate existing parks, and (3) form connections between people and the outdoors in such communities. As part of the notice of funding opportunity, NPS modified the evaluation criteria in ORLP grants to encourage States to submit projects focused on environmental justice, addressing heat islands, and support for recreation outside of military facilities. The NPS also created two deadlines for the grant - January 23, 2023, and May 31, 2023 - to encourage States to submit more grants. In standing up the BIL Orphaned Oil and Gas Wells Federal Program, DOI established evaluation criteria to prioritize disadvantaged communities, and ensure projects identify and address any disproportionate burden of adverse human health or environmental effects of orphaned wells on communities of color, low - income communities, and Tribal and Indigenous communities. C. Additional Efforts to Advance Equity The DOI launched a Women's Mentoring Program in 2022 to provide a platform for Department employees who would benefit from accessing a women - centered space. With a mission of fostering meaningful relationships through mentorships in which women build knowledge, confidence, leadership, and skills, this program is run by volunteers. It also addresses Federal workforce <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">gender</span> inequalities and supports the administration's National Strategy on <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">Gender</span> Equity and Equality. The Department's procurement staff and Office of the Solicitor collaborated to develop a vendor communications guidance document. This guidance addresses issues identified during public engagement. Specifically, the guidance seeks to improve how information is conveyed to unsuccessful offerors after award. Such meaningful communication supports new entrants and other small and disadvantaged businesses in learning about Government contracting, grow as a business, and being better poised to submit competitive proposals for future acquisitions. </p></article>

<p>A. 2022 Equity Action Plan Update Pursuant to EO 13985, 2 the Department of Justice published its first ever Equity Action Plan in April 2022. Since then, the Department has made significant progress implementing its equity priorities by improving solicitation processes, increasing opportunities for disadvantaged small businesses located in Historically Underutilized Business Zones, and strengthening mechanisms for community engagement, among others. Specific examples of the Department's ongoing progress in advancing its 2022 equity priorities include: Strengthening efforts to ensure compliance and enforcement of non - discrimination laws. Following review of implementation and administrative enforcement of the non - discrimination provisions set forth in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act ³ and the Safe Streets Act4 in connection with Federal financial assistance, the Department is taking affirmative steps to improve this work. 5 For example, the Civil Rights Division (CRT) and the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) created and co - chair a Compliance Working Group to coordinate the implementation and enforcement of these statutes, issue public guidance, revise internal standards, update tools and resources, and conduct public outreach. 6 Enhancing language access for individuals with limited English proficiency. In May 2022, DOJ hired its first - ever Language Access Coordinator (Coordinator). Since then, DOJ's Coordinator has reestablished the Language Access Working Group, which meets regularly, is comprised of representatives from various DOJ components, and provides a platform to support, guide, and oversee components ' efforts to increase meaningful access SO that communities can better access DOJ programs, communicate public safety concerns, and vindicate their rights. For example, DOJ recently published its FY 2022 - 2026 Strategic Plan in Spanish and key excerpts were published in Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, and Tagalog. In August 2023, the Department also released its updated Language Access Plan, which improves translation and interpretation services, promotes quality assurance of those services, and expands the range of tools available to serve the public.

For example, DOJ has further prioritized civil rights violations and hate crimes enforcement among the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) field offices. As of September 2023, DOJ launched the United Against Hate program in all 94 U.S. Attorneys ' Offices (USAOs) to help improve the reporting of hate crimes by informing communities on how to identify, report, and help prevent hate crimes, and to encourage trust building between law enforcement and communities. 10 Reforming law enforcement practices.

This work includes prohibiting the transfer or purchase of military - style weapons and equipment to State, Tribal, Local and Territorial (STLT) law enforcement agencies (LEAs), administering grants in a manner that is consistent with the adoption of EO 14074 ' s policies, creating accreditation standards to help encourage STLT LEAs to adopt policies consistent with the EO, and working to establish the National Law Enforcement Accountability Database. DOJ also released a Strategic Plan for supporting the goals of the Federal Interagency Alternatives and Reentry Committee, which seeks to safely reduce criminal justice system interactions, support rehabilitation during incarceration, and facilitate successful reentry. 12 Lastly, DOJ has invested in state - and local - level correctional services, including by supporting correctional and educational institutions as they enhance post - secondary educational opportunities in prisons following the reinstatement of Pell Grant eligibility for incarcerated students in July 2023. The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is also expanding access to Pell Grants within Federal correctional facilities to help incarcerated students earn college credits and / or a college degree.

<p>Research shows that through funding and technical assistance, population - specific organizations can play a significant role in effectively implementing system strategies. In fact, supporting these organizations improves outcomes by leveraging their established role as trusted community resources and relying on their proven knowledge of communities, including historically marginalized and underserved communities. For example, the White House Alternatives, Rehabilitation, and Reentry Strategic Plan stressed the need to invest in culturally responsive strategies to break the cycle of criminal justice system involvement for those disproportionately exposed to or victimized by crime.

<p>In 2020, the Department of Labor's Women's Bureau (WB) collaborated with the U.S. Census Bureau to conduct the most comprehensive analysis of the <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">gender</span> wage gap to date. The analysis shows that the majority of the gap between men and women's wages cannot be explained through measurable differences between workers, such as age, education, work history, industry, occupation, or work hours, but is more likely the result of occupational and industrial segregation. Additional studies show that providing caregiving activities to children and adults with care needs, of which women are disproportionately responsible, impose substantial lifetime economic costs; and during economic strife, like the COVID - pandemic, subsets of women have experienced slower recovery in comparison to their male counterparts. </p></article>

LAUNCHING EDUCATION SEMINARS TO SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS SEEKING DOT CONTRACTS: Small and minority - owned businesses can face hurdles in obtaining federal contracts. Many businesses without the capacity or resources to receive primary contracts are also unaware of opportunities to work as a subcontractor. To address these concerns, OSDBU launched the Master Capacity Building Series. The initial session hosted more than 500 participants, and the program has reached over 6,400 small and disadvantaged business owners as of June 2023. Technical assistance has contributed to an increase in small disadvantaged business utilization, from 18.2 % of DOT direct contract dollars in FY 2021 to 21.25 % in FY 2022. </p></article>

<p>1. Improve college access, affordability, and degree completion for underserved students to increase economic mobility. The Department aims to address barriers to college access, affordability, and completion by supporting colleges to enroll more students from underserved groups, including students of color, students from low - income backgrounds, students who are English learners, and others to raise graduation rates and close graduation rate gaps for these student populations, and offer affordable credentials of value that lead to careers offering economic mobility. 2. Implement Maintenance of Equity requirements to ensure historically underserved students have equitable resources for learning recovery. The Department aims to ensure that school districts serving historically underserved student groups, including students of color, students from low - income backgrounds, students who are English learners, students experiencing homelessness, and others have the resources they need to support learning recovery. This includes the allocation of $ 122 billion in ARP funds for Title I schools, and the ARP's Maintenance of Equity requirements to protect high poverty schools from reductions in State and local education funding. 3. Address inequities faced by justice - impacted individuals by expanding access to postsecondary learning opportunities that improve outcomes for communities and reduce recidivism rates. The Department aims to ensure that our society is more just and equitable through supporting better opportunities for education during periods of incarceration and post - release. Current initiatives are set to improve the well - being of people who are incarcerated and increase successful reentry outcomes, smoothing pathways to further education, increasing workforce readiness and engagement, and reducing recidivism and preventing crime. This includes the partnerships that exist between institutions of higher education, correctional agencies, accrediting agencies, and community - based organizations. 4. Advance equity in and through career and technical education. The Department aims to invest in career and technical education to create new and inclusive pathways to well - paying jobs and upward mobility. This includes leveraging <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> to promote strategies that reduce segregation by <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">gender</span>, <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">race</span>, and <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">ethnicity</span> in high school career and technical education (CTE) programs. 5.

<p>Funding: The Department will continue to work to increase appropriations for Title III / V grant programs to strengthen HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs, implement a new grant competition to increase research funding and infrastructure in HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs with awards to made in the fall. The Department will also ensure successful implementation of the HBCU Partners Act to strengthen federal support for HBCUs across agencies, including working with HBCUs to increase capacity to apply for federal programs, and work with States to support funding parity between 1890 land - grant HBCUs and their counterparts to address the more than $ 12 billion in funding disparities. Completion: The Department will continue to lead the Raise the Bar: Attaining College Excellence & Equity initiative, focused on supporting <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> - driven improvement in inclusive institutions to improve outcomes for students, including students of color and low - income students. The initiative will include a series of summits, playbooks, and webinars on evidence - based practices that equitably improve completion including <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span>, advising, transfer, and career - relevant learning. The initiative will also include developing new Scorecard dashboards using the Department's <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> to recognize inclusive institutions providing equitable value to students and provide postsecondary leaders with information to further increase their impact. The initiative complements the new Postsecondary Student Success Grants program to implement evidence - based interventions to increase completion rates, which will be awarded later this year. Value: The Department will continue to protect students from postsecondary institutions or programs that offer little to no financial value by publishing a low financial value watch list of programs and institutions not serving students well, and beginning to implement a new, stronger gainful - employment rule to help ensure that program graduates make more than high school graduates and earn enough to repay their loans. These protections are expected to help address the financial barriers that students of color and low - income students face in the workforce after attending institutions that either did not offer quality programs or did not support them through to degree completion yet left them with debt to repay. </p></article>

<p>1. Prioritized college access and college completion as accessibility, affordability, equitable funding, and verification remain barriers to postsecondary education. Improved Accessibility: In the wake of the Supreme Court ruling last summer limiting the ability of colleges to consider an applicant's <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">race</span> in and of itself as a factor in deciding whether to admit an applicant, the Department provided colleges and universities with resources on what admissions practices and programs remain lawful to ensure diversity, convened a National Summit on Educational Opportunity, and released a report on strategies for increasing diversity and educational opportunity. The Department also awarded over $ 40 million in Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) and TRIO Upward Bound grants in FY23 for programs focused on helping low - income students, first - generation students, and students with disabilities gain access to college. Improved Affordability: The Department worked to secure a $ 500 hundred increase in the maximum Pell Grant award, the largest increase in 10 years, in the FY23 Omnibus Appropriations bill and awarded $ 22 million in grants to colleges to address students ' basic needs, including food, housing, transportation, and childcare earlier this fiscal year. The Department has implemented a number of efforts over the last year to ease repayment and reduce debt burden for student loan borrowers, which disproportionately impacts low - income students and students of color, including recently approving an additional $ 9 billion in debt relief through fixes to income - drive repayment (IDR) and Public Student Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) programs and granting automatic relief for borrowers with total and permanent disabilities, bringing the total approved debt cancellation to $ 127 billion for nearly 3.6 million Americans. The Department also rolled out initial implementation of the SAVE plan last fall, which is the most affordable repayment plan ever created, and has already enrolled more than 4 million borrowers. Equalized Funding: The Department worked to secure a significant increase in appropriations for programs to strengthen HBCUs, TCUs, HSIs and MSIs in the FY23 budget. The Department issued Notices Inviting Applications (NIAs) for and awarded a number of Title III / V grant programs to strengthen HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs, including Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander - serving institutions (AANAPISIs) and HSIs over the last year, and published the NIA for the new $ 50 million HBCU, TCU, and MSI Research and Development Infrastructure grant last summer, which aims to provide funds to implement transformational investments in research infrastructure, including research productivity, faculty expertise, graduate programs, physical infrastructure, human capital development, and partnerships leading to increases in external funding. </p></article>

<p>Black, Indigenous, and people of color, 21 individuals with disabilities, 22 and LGBTQI + persons2 23 are overrepresented in the criminal justice system. These trends of criminal justice system involvement and incarceration represent a serious and stubborn set of challenges to equal and equitable participation in high - quality education by all segments of society. Educational attainment of people who are incarcerated or confined and justice - impacted learners is incredibly important. Unfortunately, many people in prison lack the education and workforce skills they need to succeed in the labor market. Fifty - eight percent of people who are incarcerated do not complete an education program while in prison. 24 Limited - skilled individuals caught up in the incarceration cycle may not be able to access educational programs. Given that education is an important determinant of social and economic well - being, 25 it is critical to reconnect this population to educational opportunities. Investments in rehabilitative <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Analyze">measures</span> can help facilitate the successful completion of secondary education, as well as transitions to postsecondary education and the labor market. </p></article>

<p>Access to scientific and technical assistance is often necessary for successful implementation of community science projects. Many communities with environmental justice concerns lack access to resources (such as funding, training and guidance, equipment loan programs, etc.) to develop and implement community - based participatory science programs. Examples listed below illustrate the benefits to communities of partnering with academic, NGO, or government scientists for technical support. Investment is needed in planning, <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> infrastructure, and technical support to strengthen <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> quality and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> management to support the use of community - generated <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span>. Anticipated receiving organizations in state, Tribal, and local governments need to be consulted and resourced to integrate and use community science in decision - making. Connecting hubs are needed between communities, technical support providers, and receptors in local, state, and federal government for the creation and use of community science. Resources (e.g., staff, financial, technical) are needed along the full <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> pathway from community, universities / technical support, to local, state, and federal entities to enable successful integration of participatory science into decision - making. </p></article>

This will be accomplished by leveraging coordination and collaboration in addressing cumulative impacts, with whole - of - government approaches involving multiple programs and agencies.

Participatory science results in an increase in place - based connections, environmental stewardship, and scientific literacy. Community based participatory science projects engage community members in problem solving and lead to better outcomes for communities. 32 Community - based participatory science is a core component of the EPA Participatory Science Vision. </p></article>

Developed and started implementing a roadmap for USAGov and USAGov en Español to streamline content and make it easier for the public to find and access Federal benefits and services across a digital platform that connects people with government information more than 117 million times a year. Vote.gov worked to expand access to voter registration information in communities that, due to language barriers, have not been historically part of the electorate. The platform added several Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AA and NHPI) languages including: Bengali, Khmer, Korean, Hindi, Tagalog, and Vietnamese, with Chinese (both simplified and traditional) and its first Alaska Native language, Yup'ik - Akuzipik. Login.gov partnered with Federal agencies and State governments to provide secure, accessible identity verification services for benefits and emergency assistance programs.

To support the Federal Government's exploration of questions about equitable recovery, GSA's Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) established an ARP Evaluation Portfolio with two core elements: a national evaluation conducted by a third - party research contract, and a portfolio of evaluations conducted by OES, in partnership with agencies and the White House Office of Management and Budget, on ARP - funded programs with equity goals. This body of work explores effectiveness of critical relief programs like Emergency Rental Assistance and Homeowner Assistance Fund. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) provides $ 3.4 billion for GSA's Public Buildings Service, making a significant impact on 26 Land Ports of Entry modernizations along the Canadian and Mexican border. These projects will create new good - paying jobs, bolster safety and security, and make our economy more resilient to supply chain challenges - all while serving as models for sustainability and innovation and improving community livability. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provides GSA with $ 2.15 billion for low - embodied carbon materials in construction and renovation projects, $ 975 million for GSA to support emerging and sustainable technologies, and $ 250 million to turn even more GSA facilities into High - Performance Green Buildings and accelerate efforts to achieve a net - zero Federal footprint. These investments will reduce long - term energy costs for American communities, strengthen America's domestic industrial base and catalyze innovation and job growth in homegrown industries that produce next - generation materials, products, and equipment. GSA estimates that these projects will create over 9,500 average annual economy - wide jobs across the length of the projects, support $ 2.8 billion in labor income, and generate nearly $ 1 billion in tax revenue for Federal, State and local governments. </p></article>

Finalize solicitations and awards for new Polaris and OASIS + contracts. 3 These newly launched governmentwide IT and professional services contracts offer more opportunities for small businesses to compete for prime contracts, including small business and socioeconomic set - asides. Since 2015, GSA's current OASIS vehicle has helped Federal agencies obligate more than $ 67 billion. Improve accessibility and reduce administrative burden. GSA committed to reviewing 37 Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) forms and identifying six design changes to appearance and layout (e.g., limiting use of capitalization and italics, continuity of 12 - point font and bolded text for readability) that could make the standard forms easier to navigate for people with dyslexia, limited vision and intellectual disabilities. GSA will redesign FAR forms and launch a public awareness campaign about the updates. For FY 2024, GSA will also increase its pledge to the AbilityOne program, a critical source for buying goods and services from suppliers who support the employment of people with disabilities. Further implement and enhance the Post - Award Engagement (PAE) Strategy. Fiscal Year 2023 sales <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> for SDBs and SESBs will serve as the Year 1 baseline to evaluate the efficacy of PAE plan activities.

<p>The Federal real estate footprint - including the 375 million rentable square feet owned and operated by GSA - has significant generational impact on communities nationwide. Federal construction projects act as anchors for economic security, reliable opportunities for good local jobs, defenses against the negative impacts of climate change, and can advance the overall livability and vitality of American communities. GSA's work often occurs in or adjacent to disadvantaged communities that have suffered from long - standing underinvestment and have dealt with historic challenges and barriers to equitable development. These communities tend to have poor transportation connectivity to job opportunities, higher exposure to many forms of pollution, and less access to green space. The impacts of this inequity are apparent in the persistent lower household income, high unemployment, and poorer health outcomes. 8 In order to help overcome these barriers, GSA is executing projects with enhanced stakeholder engagement and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> analysis to better inform GSA decisionmakers and project teams about local development contexts and better connect project location, design, and facility operations with the needs of those communities that will benefit from more equitable development. </p></article>

<p>Preventing Child Welfare System Involvement: We understand that families in poverty and those in Tribal and other communities are impacted by the child welfare system more than others, in some cases largely because they lack sufficient access to economic resources and community networks. Our efforts will be directed at connecting families in need to supports that enable them to stay together and preventing discriminatory and other practices that make it difficult for children, youth, and families to heal when child welfare is involved. Promoting Accessible and Welcoming Health Care: A lack of health insurance coverage and social and geographic barriers to care mean that not everyone is receiving health care that meets their needs within their communities. Our actions will promote access to comprehensive insurance coverage and quality care designed to meet the diverse needs of Americans so everyone can benefit from preventive care and effective treatments. Improving Maternal Health Outcomes: Too many women, particularly racial and ethnic minority populations, and those in <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">rural</span> areas, are losing their lives or health during pregnancy or after giving birth. Our actions will address gaps in insurance coverage and the birthing care infrastructure to ensure better maternal health outcomes. Meeting Behavioral Health Needs: The impact of the COVID - 19 pandemic increased mental health and substance use challenges for all populations, but disproportionately exacerbated the already existing behavioral health disparities among underserved racial, ethnic, and sexual minority populations. The rising rates of suicide, depression, anxiety, and substance misuse among youth and adults are impacted by a decreasing workforce, limited resources, underinsurance, and lack of culturally competent care. Our actions will improve access to behavioral health care coverage and ensure that prevention and treatment are accessible and meet the needs of all populations. Advancing Clinical Innovation: To increase our understanding of what treatments are most effective for which populations, we need to increase the diversity of our research and clinical trials to inform that science. Our actions will engage a more diverse set of populations in informing our efforts and participating in clinical research so that we can innovate to improve health and well - being outcomes. </p></article>

<p>CMS Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services (CMCS) engages, and consults states regularly as part of the Quality Improvement Technical Assistance work through the Maternal and Infant Health Initiative (MIHI). Group participants are encouraged to reach out to their beneficiaries to determine barriers to improving quality on metrics, such as attendance at postpartum care or infant well - child visits, transportation issues, or difficulty scheduling. These consultations help inform states of barriers encountered by beneficiaries. HHS OMH and CMS CMCS held a listening session to gather consumer feedback regarding using inclusive maternal language (especially as it relates to the word " " maternal " " and non - binary or <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">gender</span> conforming people). Participants included professionals with direct clinical, research, or system - level expertise on inclusive language or experience in providing affirming care for non - binary and transgender patients. One key takeaway was that Inclusive language is important to make people feel cared for by their providers. NIH sponsored the Connecting the Community for Maternal Health Challenge to encourage and reward nonprofit community - based or advocacy organizations to develop research capabilities and infrastructure to pursue maternal health research projects. The challenge offered approximately $ 3 million in prizes, distributed across multiple phases of the competition to organizations that successfully completed the objectives and requirements of each phase. Three webinars introduced the challenge sponsors at NIH, provided general guidance on proposal submission, and shared the opportunities that participation in this challenge provide. Ongoing webinars are providing guidance to participants in building and sustaining their research activities. </p></article>

Lack of diversity in clinical research has the potential to hinder innovation. Including populations that have been underrepresented in clinical trials and medical studies can help researchers better understand variation in the safety and effectiveness of interventions, identify new biological processes, and lead to new discoveries that can benefit other populations. 55 Evidence from clinical studies help inform health recommendations, insurance coverage, and reimbursement of healthcare services. Without representation of specific groups in trials and studies, we may lack confidence about how new therapeutics will impact all populations. A lack of representation in clinical studies can impede access to effective medical interventions for underrepresented groups if they are not included to build the evidence base to begin with. 56 56 Additional barriers contributing to underrepresentation of racial and ethnic minority patients ' participation in clinical trials include mistrust or fear and stigma of participation, lack of comfort with the clinical trial process, lack of information about clinical trials, time and resource constraints associated with clinical trial participation, and lack of clinical trial awareness. 57 </p></article>

<p>Advance sustainable homeownership and wealth generation by reducing appraisal bias and expanding access to homeownership: HUD is dedicated to ensuring all people have access to affordable homeownership and the opportunity to build generational wealth. To better serve individuals and families, HUD has expanded the Family Self Sufficiency program for HUD - assisted residents to initiate a path to realizing their homeownership dreams. HUD will also support current homeowners by combatting the historic impacts of racial bias in the home appraisal process that erodes equity and robs Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities of the opportunity to maintain and grow generational wealth. Reduce barriers and enhance support for protected classes by enforcing fair housing regulations, advancing housing justice, and improving rental assistance: HUD's primary focus in advancing housing justice is to expand the Department's role in proactively supporting and protecting underserved communities through increased Fair Housing Law enforcement and compliance. As detailed within this Equity Action Plan, HUD will enact a dedicated training curriculum to national fair housing partners to ensure that knowledge of Fair Housing protections is widespread and actionable in local communities. Similarly, HUD will employ targeted efforts to engage with key populations, including those impacted by <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">gender</span> - based violence, LGBTQIA + communities, and people impacted by the criminal justice system, to improve the administration and delivery of HUD - assisted programs and services. Reduce racial and ethnic disparities in homeless systems through identifying and addressing barriers to engagement by underserved populations: Promoting equity is a key component in reducing homelessness. People experiencing homelessness are among the most underserved and overlooked - most especially Black, Hispanic, and Native American or Alaska Native people, who experienced increases in homelessness and are significantly overrepresented among this population. Through specialized research and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> gathering initiatives, the Agency will continue to improve its ability to better identify, engage, and re - house Black, Brown, Indigenous and other systematically disadvantaged people experiencing unsheltered homelessness. In addition, HUD will expand its work with program and community partners to incorporate the voice and leadership of people with lived experience to create tailored, equitable solutions for individuals ' needs to accentuate a new approach to homelessness relief and further equal access to eviction protection resources. Advance sustainable communities by strengthening climate resilience and energy efficiency, promoting environmental justice, and driving the creation of good - paying jobs: Climate change is a worsening crisis that impacts communities across the United States and the world. Due to historic discrimination and disinvestment, systemically underserved communities often suffer climate change's consequences most acutely, deepening pre - existing societal inequities. The importance of addressing this crisis is reflected in HUD's efforts to create and expand programs that reduce assisted resident exposure to climate - related hazards. While doing so, HUD will improve energy efficiency in HUD - assisted housing and create pathways to good paying jobs.

HUD will evaluate the effectiveness of the Moving To Work (MTW) expansion's asset - building cohort and application of lessons learned to future HUD program design. MTW is a demonstration program for PHAs that provides them the opportunity to design and test innovative, locally designed strategies that use Federal dollars more efficiently, help residents find employment and become self - sufficient, and increase housing choices for low - income families. This cohort of the MTW Expansion will evaluate policies that seek to encourage savings and improve credit for assisted households. HUD is continuing to refine the loss mitigation options available to help borrowers who fall behind on their mortgage payments to get back on track and preserve homeownership. HUD will maximize homeownership for creditworthy first - time homebuyers and preserve homeownership for existing homeowners. Historical <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> collected from the FHA Annual Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund report, has shown that FHA has consistently maintained an 80 percent or above single - family purchase endorsement for borrowers that are first - time homebuyers. This report has also shown that FHA has maintained a sub 30 percent re - default rate after a loss mitigation action. To continue this trend and improve these metrics, HUD will maximize homeownership for creditworthy first - time homebuyers and preserve homeownership for existing homeowners. By September 30, 2025, HUD will maintain a first - time homebuyer rate of at least 80 % for newly endorsed FHA - insured purchase mortgages and a re - default rate for seriously delinquent homeowners who received a loss mitigation action that is below 30 %. </p></article>

<p>HUD's FHEO Annual Reports on Fair Housing document the number of complaints filed with HUD and Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP) agencies each year. HUD and FHAP agencies consistently receive more than 10,000 complaints per year (11,741 in FY 2022), with disability as the most common basis for alleged discrimination, followed by <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">race</span> and sex. For more than 40 years, HUD's Housing Discrimination studies have documented the persistence of housing discrimination among protected classes. For example, HUD's 2017 study of Rental Housing Discrimination on the Basis of Mental Disabilities found that individuals with mental illness and intellectual or developmental disabilities experienced significant levels of adverse differential treatment in the rental market, including being less likely to receive a response to their inquiries and less likely to be told a unit was available. A 2021 study of Housing Discrimination Against Same - Sex Couples and Transgender Individuals found that housing providers treated lesbians comparably to heterosexual women seeking rental housing, told gay men about fewer available rental units than they told heterosexual men, and told transgender testers about fewer units than they told cisgender home seekers. The pervasive use of criminal background checks during tenant screening can create a barrier to renting housing, even though that information may be incomplete or inaccurate and information about past criminal history is not necessarily a reliable predictor of housing success. Studies have also found that Black and Hispanic communities, are disproportionately affected by tenant screening practices that include a criminal background check. A growing body of evidence shows that the provision of housing assistance, particularly when accompanied with supportive services, can help reduce recidivism and decrease involvement in the criminal justice system, thereby strengthening public safety. HUD's forthcoming study of the Housing Needs of Survivors of Human Trafficking finds that survivors of human trafficking and those at risk of trafficking, both highly vulnerable populations, face substantial hurdles in finding affordable housing related to landlord screening for criminal background, credit history, and rental history. </p></article>

<p>HUD's 2021 Annual Homeless Assessment Report finds that 10 percent of Black heads of households in poverty and 12 percent of Native American or Alaska Native households in poverty experienced sheltered homelessness at some point in 2021, compared to 3 percent of all households in poverty. That Black and Brown people experience homelessness at higher rates than white households is consistent with HUD's research on Worst Case Housing Needs, which finds that Black and Hispanic households are more likely to be very low - income, renters, and paying more than 50 percent of their income on rent than other groups. These statistics highly correlate with higher probably that someone will experience homelessness. Research suggests that Black and Brown households, particularly low - income renter households headed by Black women, experience evictions at disproportionately high rates. Evictions contribute to long - term housing instability and homelessness. Other factors contributing to disproportionate rates of homelessness among Black and Brown people, include criminal justice histories and discrimination from landlords and employers.

Researcher Diana Hernandez demonstrates in two papers how weatherization can be a catalyst for reducing the energy burden affecting low - income individuals and ultimately improve health and social outcomes among African Americans. Through the publications Climate Justice Starts at Home: Building Resilient Housing to Reduce Disparate Impacts From Climate Change in Residential Settings and Energy efficiency as energy justice: addressing racial inequities through investments in people and places she finds that Black households, even when disaggregating income, are more likely to live in less - efficient homes, demonstrating the legacy of housing segregation, redlining, and lack of equitable access to financing. These additional energy costs affect utility costs. She poses not just utility assistance but weatherization and green energy improvements as mechanisms to reducing environmental and economic injustices. To complement the body of literature on this topic, the White House Council on Environmental Quality developed the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST) using nationally consistent <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> and an approach that combines environmental and <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">demographic</span> indicators to identify historically disadvantaged communities through an interactive map.

<p>HUD works with Continuums of Care (CoC) nationally that prepare community plans to organize and deliver housing and services to meet the specific needs of people who are homeless as they move to stable housing and maximum self - sufficiency. As part of our equity focus, SNAPS conducted its second Coordinated Entry Equity Demonstration, deploying teams of technical assistance coaches to 15 Continuums of Care covering a broad range of communities. The goal of the demonstration was to design a more equitable assessment and prioritization process to improve conditions and outcomes for all Black and Brown people. The technical assistance coaching teams included providers with experience in racial equity and housing justice work, coordinated entry design, lived experience of homelessness, and navigating homeless systems and other related disciplines. In partnership with Black and Brown people as well as people with lived expertise of homelessness, CoCs identified system disparities through analyzing local <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span>, agreed upon focus areas, and tested racially equitable coordinated entry system processes in service of significantly transforming the experience and housing stability of those disproportionately represented in local homeless responsive systems.

DAPR increases equity in NASA's solicitation process by decreasing barriers caused by hidden bias. Award Bridge Program Seed Funding (BPSF). The SMD Bridge Program's primary goal is to promote participation of traditionally underrepresented groups in NASA's workforce and STEM disciplines through investment in science and engineering research at Under - Resourced Institutions (URIs). In response to community input and to enable future participation in the Bridge Program, the BPSF awards will fund partnership - development projects with NASA Centers. BPSF seeks to facilitate new and expanded partnerships between URIs and NASA researchers that may grow into Bridge partnerships, reducing barriers to entry and enabling participating institutions to become well - positioned to submit future proposals to the SMD Bridge Program. </p></article>

<p>Engagement: Throughout the year, NASA engaged the public through numerous methods to identify and gain insight on the barriers outlined in this plan and best practices to increase access to NASA programs and information, which informed the development of strategies to overcome these barriers and develop this EAP. Since the development of our 2022 EAP, NASA has held multiple small business listening sessions and solicited feedback through RFIs (June 2021, April 2023, June 2023). Through OSTEM, we hosted an Equity Action Plan K - 12 Stakeholder Town Hall, the Better Together Conference, and expanded our annual Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) - Minority Serving Institutions (MSI) Technology Infusion Road Tour. In January 2023, we hosted a Tribal Consultation forum open to all 574 federally recognized tribal nations.

<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Asian American Foundation collaborated to support the White House Initiative on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders by introducing the " " Demystifying Federal Grants " " webinar series. This series was created to provide valuable knowledge and practical advice to assist community - based organizations in successfully applying for federal grants and accessing resources. NSF's chief diversity and inclusion officer (CDIO) has collaborated with a dedicated team of program directors (PDs) to leverage its review and awards process to ensure the Foundation's funded programs can reach the broad pool of untapped scientific talent. These discussions have yielded critical insights into how NSF can better support the inclusion of underrepresented scientists by emphasizing the importance of more general impact statements in grant applications, ensuring diversity within review panels, and increasing participation of researchers from Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). Under the June 2022 Executive Order 14075, Advancing Equality for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex (LGBTQI +) Individuals, the Office of the Chief Statistician of the United States provided recommendations for Federal agencies on best practices to collect self - reported sexual orientation and <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">gender</span> identity (SOGI) <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> in federal statistical surveys. In an effort led by the CDIO, a dedicated team of individuals across the agency has developed a pilot survey to collect voluntary, non - personally identifiable SOGI <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> from within the NSF workforce. These efforts are taking place in concert with the National Council of Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) efforts to pilot the collection of SOGI <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> in their national surveys. D. Advancing Equity Through Key Legislation: NSF is committed to the principle that a diverse scientific workforce is vital to promoting advances in knowledge, innovation, and the global competitiveness of the U.S. scientific enterprise. Under the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, NSF appointed its first CDIO in December. The office of the CDIO is responsible for guiding and leading the Foundation's strategic plans to promote diversity, equity, inclusion, and access (DEIA) in all NSF - funded activities. In addition to advocating for DEIA within the Foundation's workforce and funded programs, the CDIO is partnering with other agencies and thought leaders to advance the mission of broadening participation in the U.S. science and technology enterprise. The CDIO is guided by the principle that diversity, in all forms, enriches the scientific community, drives breakthroughs, and brings forth lasting solutions to urgent problems. </p></article>

<p>research results greatly exceed costs " " and that " " any economic burden falling on individual researchers resulting from a zero - embargo publication policy would likely be offset by the greater benefits of increased visibility, consumption, and potential impact that their research would realize. " " The OSTP Economic Landscape report acknowledges that limited transparency on publication costs indicates that many cost implications are based on estimates. An article by then Acting OSTP Director and her colleagues (Nelson, A., Marcum, C., & Isler, J. (2022). Public Access to Advance Equity. Issues in Science and Technology, 39 (1), 33 - 35.) notes that " " eliminating the barriers to discovery and research outputs are critically important to realizing the commitment to equity [ and the ] commitment to providing research, innovation, cures, and improved health and well - being to the nation and the world. " " A report of the General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) November 2021 meeting in Paris explains the benefits of open science ecosystems related to the equity and sustainable development goals and formally recommends that member states " " collaborate in bilateral, regional, multilateral and global initiatives for the advancement of open science. " " The report recommends the creation of, encouraging or enabling policy environment, to which implementation of NSF's public access plan would contribute, and notes that " " a paywalled method of publication, where immediate access to scientific publications is only granted in exchange for payment, is not aligned with the present Recommendation. " " Input derived from NSF participation in the Subcommittee on Open Science (SOS) and deliverables from the subgroups of the SOS. In addition to recognizing the positive equity impact of public access policies, NSF recognizes potential equity challenges that could arise from public access implementation. The NSF Public Access and Open Science Working Group's Equity of Access subgroup addresses this issue by identifying potential inequities arising from public access guidelines at different implementation phases. The literature points to four specific areas of equity challenges: (1) challenges for researchers and institutions based on resources available for public access implementation; (2) challenges based on methodologies and disciplines based on variation in public access infrastructure; (3) challenges for historically marginalized groups for whom critical issues of reclamation of rights and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> sovereignty exist; and (4) challenges for international collaborations due to variation in international regulations and practices in <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> sharing. To address these challenges, NSF has identified four priority areas to manifest the equity promises of public access policies and minimize challenges. Actions include: Consult with Pls and institutions to understand and respond to potential equity challenges. A key priority is focusing on under - represented and under - resourced institutions and the potential for increases in public access implementation costs. Understanding and <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Analyze">measuring</span> investment in public access compliance's financial and non - financial costs must improve.

<p>External engagement of impacted communities. NSF is committed to addressing the unintended equity consequences of changing public access policies. Periodic engagement will, therefore, provide opportunities for researchers, publishers, universities, libraries, and the public to alert NSF to equity challenges that should be addressed during implementation. Gathering input from NSF staff to inform policy implementation. Within NSF, five active subgroups of the Public Access and Open Science Working Group have participation from approximately fifty people across NSF; this cross - agency participation will continue to implement the updated public access plan equitably. The subgroups are 1) <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">Data</span> Management and Sharing, 2) Equity, 3) the FAIR Open Science program, 4) Outreach, and 5) enhancing NSF's Public Access Repository (the access portal for NSF - funded publications). Possible development of targeted Dear Colleague Letters and solicitations (e.g., further development of the Open Knowledge Network, funding of Research Coordination Networks, or other aligned NSF funding activities). Such funding actions are expected to improve access to cyberinfrastructure supporting the knowledge economy, ensuring that the ability to comply with and benefit from updated Public Access policies does not rely on access to specialized knowledge about or ability to pay for supporting infrastructure. This funding will also ensure that the work of further opening the scientific scholarly system will include those that have too often been underrepresented and that underserved researchers have access to the funding NSF provides to make science more accessible to all. While funding opportunities will be varied, they will likely build on the success of existing programs such as: FAIROS RCN, which last year issued ten awards totaling $ 12.5M, to build and enhance national coordination among researchers and other stakeholders to advance FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> principles and open - science practices, advancing the availability of supporting cyberinfrastructure that will enable equity in the ability to comply with new policies.

<p>NSF's updated Public Access Plan (2023) is intended to ensure that the ability to publish or access NSF - funded studies to support research, education, and new economic activity will not be hindered by a researcher's ability to pay. Researchers can upload their publications without cost through NSF's Public Access Repository. Implementation of the updated NSF Public Access Plan will ensure that the research community and members of the public have immediate access to scientific publications. NSF will also require researchers to provide access to research <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> from NSF - funded studies. Research <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> must be uploaded to publicly accessible locations (links via publications in journals and repositories) to the extent possible, with restrictions allowed to address privacy, security concerns, or other recognized <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> access limitations. Implementing these policies will ensure equitable access to NSF - funded research and that all Americans, including scientists from underserved and under - resourced research institutions, can access NSF research products, publications, and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span>.

<p>As indicated by scientific studies / literature, NSF - funded research, and NSF - led evaluations, sexual and other forms of harassment present barriers to full participation by underrepresented groups in the scientific endeavor. Remote fieldwork areas and sites also present unique challenges that can increase the likelihood of harassment, which may include challenging physical conditions, social isolation, and limited communication methods. NSF will expand efforts to address sexual and other forms of harassment, including by strengthening accountability <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Analyze">measures</span> and extending the reach of NSF harassment prevention efforts to research activities at field sites and on research vessels to help ensure all NSF - funded research and learning environments are free from sexual harassment and other forms of harassment. </p></article>

<p>By funding pertinent, novel, basic science resulting in valuable research <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> and publications (referred to as " " research products " "), NSF contributes to all Whole - of - Government Equity Objectives. Access to research products seeks to break down barriers that ensure institutions have access to the best and most recent scientific advances and the ability to make their research accessible immediately. These advantages often come with a cost - such as publication and subscription fees - which members of the broader public and less - resourced scientific communities may be unable to afford. Thus, each of the eight equity areas identified - Civil Rights, Criminal Justice, Economic Justice, Educational Equity, Environmental Justice, Global Equality, Health Equity, and Housing Justice and Community Investment - will have an opportunity to advance via the open science and public access efforts of NSF, as research in areas relevant to each become more accessible to all Americans. </p></article>

<p>In analysis of the Current Population Survey, the Kaiser Family Foundation reports that those enrolled in employer - based health insurance with incomes at or below 199 % of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) pay an average of 10.4 % of their family income on health insurance premiums and out - of - pocket costs compared to an overall average of four percent for all employer - based enrollees. Health care premiums as a percentage of Federal pay have outpaced wage increases; for example, in 2012, a self only premium in the most popular nationwide plan represented 4.8 % of a GS - 5, Step 5 salary; in 2016, that figure rose to 5.6 %; and, in 2022, it is 5.9 %.

Priorities for the coming year include requiring health plans to offer expanded fertility benefits, including artificial insemination and coverage of 3 cycles of In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) related drugs annually; encouraging closer coordination with Medicare Part D employer group waiver plans for annuitants with FEHB and Medicare; and leveraging reductions in cost sharing resulting from the Inflation Reduction Act. 2023 Employee Wellness Guidance and Ensuring Access to Mental Health Services: In May 2023, OPM issued Employee Wellness Guidance that is designed to foster the mental, emotional, and physical prosperity of Federal employees through workplace wellness tools and resources which can optimize both employee and organizational success. By reframing Employee Assistance Programs as wellness programs, OPM is striving to de - stigmatize the use of mental health services. We also have continued efforts to achieve mental health parity through access to mental health services offered by FEHB Carriers, by working with Carriers to ensure mental health services are reimbursed similarly to physical health services. Carrier Letter on Contraception: In August 2022, OPM issued a Carrier Letter on Contraception reminding Carriers of their responsibilities to offer contraceptive services with no enrollee cost - sharing and updating FEHB guidance to be consistent with guidance from the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Treasury, and Labor on coverage of certain contraceptive services and products, including emergency contraceptives. In particular, the guidance required FEHB Carriers to implement " " exceptions processes " " that enable enrollees to petition for coverage of alternate forms of contraception than those listed in the plan brochure when warranted using expeditious and timely exception processes. In support of Executive Order " " Strengthening Access to Affordable, High - Quality Contraception and Family Planning " ", in the fourth quarter of 2023, OPM will share updated guidance on promoting access to affordable, high - quality contraception.

<p>For FYs 2018 through 2022, we received over 4.5 million requests through the Telephone Interpreter Services (TIS) for 194 languages. During that time, about 80 percent of the language requests were for Spanish, Vietnamese, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Russian. For FYs 2018 through 2022, there were 20 languages that were often requested through our TIS that we were not able to provide. Nearly one in four American Indians and Alaska Natives have LEP or speak a language other than English at home. 19 For FYs 2018 through 2022, we received more requests for Navajo language than for German language assistance through the TIS. While two of our offices near the Navajo Reservation have employees who are proficient in Navajo language, we need TIS to provide service outside of this area. Through our Office of Native American Partnerships, we receive ongoing feedback from advocates in Tribal communities. Their recommendations to overcome complex applications and language barriers include: Assistance from Tribal Benefit Coordinators who understand the native language sufficiently to assist applicants. Assistance from a member from the Tribe, who understands the native language and Tribal health documentation sufficiently, in the absence of an Indian Health Service Coordinator to assist applicants. Outreach to inform Alaskan applicants that interpreter services may help them overcome barriers and improve application outcomes. This recommendation is based on research provided during the White House 10th Annual Native Language Summit in Albuquerque, NM. Through our LEP Steering Committee, we receive ongoing feedback and recommendations from advocates about ways to improve language access, <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Analyze">analyze</span> these recommendations, and take appropriate action, such as, reminding employees on how to use the TIS.

<p>Underserved small businesses often lack the access to capital they need to expand and grow the products and services they provide, often within the underserved communities they support. Businesses often need financial documentation, a business plan, accounting capacity, or a legal structure to apply for and receive commercial loans. These requirements are often beyond the capacity of underserved small businesses. Underserved communities lack financing for neighborhood essentials, such as schools, childcare, housing, and health - care clinics. As noted by the Urban Institute, CDFIs struggle to meet all needs for community development. While they can support some development needs, they look for additional resources to support the overall community ecosystem. CDFIs and MDIs that serve under - resourced stakeholders lack access to flexible capital to pass along to the communities they serve to not only help businesses grow but to also provide much needed services to their communities.

<p>Treasury has established the Equity Hub within the Office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility to lead research and policy analysis that supports the Department in its effort to drive toward a more fair and equitable economy. In recognition of the sovereignty of, and our partnership with, Tribal Nations, Treasury's Office of Tribal and Native Affairs is responsible for advising on departmental issues related to Tribal governments and Native communities, including the administration of $ 30 billion in direct Tribal set - asides to the benefit of over 2.5 million Tribal citizens. The Office also conducts consultations with Tribes and coordinates outreach. As of June 2023, the Office has hosted over 45 formal consultations and 700 Tribal engagement sessions. Treasury has made significant efforts to engage with stakeholders and the public on topics related to equity. For instance, in December 2022, the Department held the first TACRE meeting, with subsequent meetings in March, June, and September 2023. Since their first convening, the Committee established cross - cutting principles and priorities and has submitted 13 recommendations to Treasury. Recommendations are currently under review and address issues such as <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> transparency, taxpayer access to Direct File, direct engagement with taxpayers who could benefit from tax credits and working with CDFIs to promote diversification through the certification and re - certification processes. The Department collaborated with 12 national Hispanic and Latino organizations to host the first Treasury Department summit on investing in the economic future of the Latino community in June 2023 to elevate challenges and opportunities facing that community. The Latino Economic Summit brought together nearly 100 leaders from the private, non - profit, and government sectors to identify opportunities to unleash the potential of the Latino community and the entire economy. Treasury's Office of Civil Rights and Equal Employment Opportunity (OCRE) continues to work with the White House to encourage the appointment of Latino staff and continues working with community lenders to unlock potential that had previously been sidelined. The result will be economic growth within the Latino community, as well as shared prosperity for everyone. Treasury launched a blog series detailing the origins of racial economic disparities and the implications for the national economy. OCRE has made significant efforts to increase civil rights compliance and equal opportunity throughout the Department with the implementation of a new external civil rights language access plan and complaint tracking system. OCRE also worked with the CDFI Fund to implement pre - award civil rights compliance reviews in their financial assistance award process.

<p>Under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, Treasury supported the economic recovery for communities and individuals impacted by COVID - 19 through the ARP. For example, the Department and the CDFI Fund have deployed historic amounts of capital to CDFIs and MDIs - institutions that have a demonstrated track record of reaching financially underserved borrowers. In addition, through the ECIP, Treasury has made close to $ 8.4 billion in investments in 170 community financial institutions, in addition to over $ 1.73 billion in grants through the CDFI ERP, and a historic $ 226 million investment in 68 Puerto Rican cooperativas, or cooperative community financial institutions. New ECIP reporting <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> made available in October 2023, reflecting lending in the final six months of 2022, showed that ECIP lenders originated a total of approximately $ 26 billion in loans, of which approximately 75 % went to low - and moderate - income borrowers, borrowers in <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">rural</span> communities and other categories of qualified lending. Approximately one third of their total originations, $ 8.6 billion, were " " deep impact " " loans, made to the hardest - to - serve borrowers, including those that are low - income, residents on Tribal lands and in US Territories and owners of very small businesses. Treasury leveraged the ERA program to create the first - ever nationwide infrastructure to prevent eviction, with more than 12.3 million household payments to families at risk of eviction as of June 30, 2023. This program has been particularly effective at reaching low - income and / or traditionally underserved renters, including Black and women - headed households. By reimagining how the IRS serves families, the IRS delivered half of the expanded Child Tax Credit (CTC) via monthly payments from July to December 2021. Treasury also collaborated with Code for America, a non - governmental non - profit, to build a streamlined, mobile - friendly portal in English and Spanish to make it easier for families to access the expanded CTC. New Census <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> released in 2022 showed that the expanded CTC was the leading driver behind a 46 percent decline in child poverty in 2021 - cutting the annual child poverty rate to its lowest - ever recorded level including record lows in Black, Hispanic, Native American, Asian, and white child poverty. Additionally, the permanent lifting of restrictions that prevented some Puerto Rican families from receiving the CTC led to 200,000 more Puerto Rican families receiving the credit when they filed taxes in 2022 compared to the year prior. As of September 2023, Treasury has approved 54 out of 56 state and territory applications for SSBCI Capital Programs totaling over $ 8.2 billion in allocations, and has announced approvals of up to $ 73 million corresponding to applications representing 39 Tribes.

<p>Working with key collaborators is an essential component of a successful equity action plan. This means identifying ways to cross - pollinate the exchange of knowledge, <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span>, ideas, and best practices across agencies to break down silos that inhibit swift and measurable success. We recognize that working in partnership with collaborating agencies is a key driver that will enable us to successfully attain our goals. For example, the Interagency Community Investment Committee (ICIC) is a collaboration between the Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Treasury, Department of Transportation, the Small Business Administration, Department of Energy, and the Environmental Protection Agency to strengthen capital delivery systems for communities and support the flow of community development capital and resources to underserved communities. The ICIC partners work with corporate and philanthropic organizations to align resources in a way that will magnify the impact of public investments. </p></article>

<p>a) 2022 Equity Action Plan Update (pursuant to EO 13985) Since the launch of WorkwithUSAID.gov in November 2021, USAID has approved more than 4,700 partner profiles in the platform's Partner Directory, and of those partners, more than 1,600 have completed the pre - engagement assessment. By registering in the Partner Directory and taking the Pre - Engagement Assessment, potential partners are able to increase the visibility of their work, connect with others in the development community, and assess whether or not they are ready to respond to a USAID solicitation. The team has translated the top 20 resources on the platform into French, Spanish, and Arabic for use in host countries where USAID works. These resources are helping to bridge the gap for local entities that are not fluent in English as USAID continues to develop additional documentation in foreign languages. USAID's Inclusive Development e - learning module is now mandatory for all of the workforce. As of June 2023, 86 percent (11,200 out of approximately 13,000) of USAID's workforce have received the training on Inclusive Development. USAID held three external and three internal consultations with stakeholders, delivered two informational webinars for USAID staff, held consultations with program participants across USAID Missions and briefed all Bureaus and Independent Offices (B / IOs) on the development of the ' Know Your Protections ' (KYP) document (formerly known as the ' Beneficiaries Bill of Rights ' - BBoR). This document aims to summarize and highlight existing protections for USAID program participants, making them accessible and easily understandable. The document has been revised and is currently undergoing clearance at the agency. USAID developed the Social, Economic, and Environmental Accountability Mechanism (SEE - AM), which advances program participant protections. The mechanism provides a channel for program participants and affected communities to inform the Agency of harm experienced in relation to USAID's programs and projects overseas. USAID secured program funds for and onboarded a full - time Accountability Mechanism Official to manage SEE - AM design and implementation, and coordination of complaints processing. USAID launched the updated Acquisition and Assistance (A & A) Strategy and Implementation Plan in FY 2023, incorporating DEIA principles, such as: USAID simplified and reduced its onerous pre - award risk survey for local organizations seeking USAID funding. Agency lowered the barrier to entry by promoting more opportunities where applicants submit an initial concept paper (about five pages) before they are invited to submit a full application (typically 30 pages or more). This makes the initial step less costly for applicants. Issued a Renewal Award Guide and Template to train A & A staff to use a mechanism that leverages practices from collaborating, learning and adapting, and responds to adjustments in dynamic operating environments. The Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) sent a notice to remind prime contractors about the requirement of reporting <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> against their small business subcontracting plan and to improve the accuracy of <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> they submit. </p></article>

<p>The Agency identified and created a cadre of training, tools, and resources to streamline proposal and evaluation processes. M Bureau provides staff a platform to share innovative practices and systems to streamline procurement processes through the A & A Innovation Community of Practice. USAID updated its Youth Policy and released the new <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">Gender</span> Equality and Women's Empowerment Policy in March 2023. USAID released its new LGBTQI + Inclusive Development Policy in August 2023 and Strategic Religious Engagement Policy in September 2023. These policies reiterate the importance of and clarify approaches to inclusion and equity in USAID's programs, for USAID staff and stakeholders. USAID recently announced the launch of the Racial and Ethnic Equity Initiative, and teams are conducting assessments and collecting <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> from USAID Missions overseas to build a knowledge base of operational practices and best practices that have successfully advanced social inclusion and racial equity in foreign assistance programming. Exposure to these best practices and technical guidance will encourage the adoption of quality equity programs on a broader scale. USAID Missions and Bureaus are now required to report on a new key issue narrative in their annual reports capturing racial and ethnic equity. They also must annually report on the percentage of completed evaluations with at least one local expert on the evaluation team. USAID released the Agency's highest level policy document, the Policy Framework, in March 2023. The Policy Framework emphasizes a commitment to embed DEIA principles across our programs, people, processes, policies, and practices so that development gains are more locally - led and benefit people of all backgrounds and identities. b) Environmental Justice Scorecard (pursuant to section 223 of EO 14008) USAID is not required to complete the Environmental Justice Scorecard. USAID promotes environmental equity and monitors progress through the Global Action for Climate Equity. c) Additional Efforts to Advance Equity Fourteen country - level Inclusive Development Assessments (IDAs), which aim to map the context and needs of marginalized groups through an intersectional lens to improve equity in programming, have been performed across the Agency. The ID Hub's Inclusive Development Activity for Mission Support (IDAMS) has begun work on three additional IDAs and is poised to to scale up these activities in FY 2024. The Office of Civil Rights established the External Civil Rights Division covering Title VI and other relevant civil rights authorities to ensure USAID complies with Title VI requirements under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Division receives and addresses complaints of discrimination in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance The External Civil Rights Division's internal website launched in June 2023, which educates USAID staff on the Title VI legal requirements and statutes and how they apply to USAID programs and partners. In addition to the significant progress made in awarding more funds directly to local entities - which, in FY2022 reached the highest level ($ 1.6 billion) and percent (10.2 percent) in over a decade - USAID has developed a new method to track the extent to which the Agency's programming is locally led.

Additionally, we are still building our capacity to apply certain local and Indigenous knowledge to a range of USAID programming, particularly from historically marginalized racial and ethnic communities.

<p>The five priority action items take these barriers into account and provide a set of steps USAID will take to address them, including developing new guidance to advance equity among racial and ethnic underserved communities and implementing policy requirements to have agency <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">Gender</span> Advisors with the experience and expertise needed to integrate <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">gender</span> equality and women's empowerment across USAID programming.

Several offices and teams within USAID prioritizes a relationship with the public to decrease these barriers. For example, USAID's Office of Small & Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) undertakes critical Agency outreach and engagement with small, disadvantaged business (SDB) associations and resource partners to educate on how to work with USAID. OSDBU also leads the agency's efforts to integrate the Federal Small Business Program into agency - wide policy and acquisition planning, expand agency and U.S. small business interaction through training and outreach, and partner with other federal agencies to learn and share best practices. </p></article>

<p>USDA is committed to continually improving services to communities marginalized, underserved, and overburdened by pollution, with a particular emphasis on the dozens of departmental programs covered by the Administration's Justice40 Initiative, pursuant to Executive Order 14008 - programs whose investments relate to climate change, clean energy and energy efficiency, clean transit, affordable and sustainable housing, training and workforce development, remediation and reduction of legacy pollution, and the development of critical clean water and wastewater infrastructure. Across USDA, over 12,000 grants, agreements, and contracts associated with Justice40 Initiative covered programs were distributed in FY 2022, promoting nearly $ 7 billion in economic development. The programs have a broad and varied reach. In FY 2022, for example, the Forest Service's Job Corps program provided more than 1,500 young adults from underserved backgrounds with over 273,000 hours of training focused on firefighting, conservation, and <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">rural</span> development, furthering employment opportunities.

<p>Barriers to Equity: <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">Rural</span> communities and the enterprises within them sometimes struggle to get financial or technical assistance from highly competitive federal programs whose funding formulas favor larger, urban areas. These programs often have burdensome and unrealistic requirements, including complicated processes, inconsistent rule implementation, and delays, which are significant barriers to access. Another barrier to equity in <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">rural</span> communities is insufficient outreach in some communities, which can exclude people who lack awareness of or experience with federal programs. In turn, communities lose their trust in and willingness to engage with the federal government. Still other barriers relate to inadequate infrastructure, such as broadband access, which prevents businesses and individuals from fully competing and participating in the digital age. </p></article>

<p>OMB illustrates that VA contracting is increasingly dominated by established vendors rather than new entrants. As VA has reduced its total vendor base from 11,964 in FY 2020 to 10,887 in FY 2022, the share of established vendors (not recent or new entrants) has increased. In FY 2020, 61.7 % of VA's vendors were established vendors. In FY 2022, the share of established vendors increased to 66.6 %. This suggests the reduction in total vendors is occurring at the expense of new or recent entrants. An analysis of VA - funded contract actions from the Federal Procurement <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">Data</span> System demonstrates how the Veterans First procurement hierarchy reduces the number of contract opportunities for non - Veteran disadvantaged firms. In FY 2022, out of $ 6.3 billion in contract dollars awarded through some type of set - aside, VA awarded $ 5.7 billion (91 %) specifically using the SDVOSB set - aside. Since the SDVOSB set - aside is first on VA's procurement hierarchy, this result is predictable. However, the second tier on VA's procurement hierarchy (VOSB set - aside) was used to award only $ 59 million, a dramatically lower figure. Awards through the HUBZone and 8 (a) Business Development Program set asides were even lower. Alternatively, the last tier on VA's set - aside hierarchy received the second highest volume of dollars; $ 461 million were awarded through the general small business set - aside. These <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> illustrate two factors. First, the procurement hierarchy tends to screen out contracting opportunities for programs lower on the hierarchy. Second, the intermediate tiers such as HUBZone, </p></article>

<p>VA proposed modifications to the regulatory framework for eligibility determinations involving Veterans ' military discharges that may be considered " " dishonorable " " for VA benefit eligibility purposes. The proposed revision of 38 C.F.R. § 3.12, Update and Clarify Regulatory Bars to Benefits Based on Character of Discharge, addresses disparities related to Veteran status and eligibility determination that are a major issue for homeless Veterans as well as LGBTQ + and other minority Veterans. While rulemaking is still ongoing, VA highlights the following public - facing efforts to hear concerns from underrepresented groups: July 2020: Published a proposed rule in the Federal Register to amend 38 C.F.R. § 3.12 (85 FR 41471) Update and Clarify Regulatory Bars to Benefits Based on Character of Discharge; September 2021: Published a Request for Information (RFI) to the Federal Register for additional public commentary on aspects of the proposed regulation (86 FR 50513) Discharge; and Held listening sessions in October 2021. VA published a request for information (RFI) on June 20, 2023, for the public to provide <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)" title="Data">data</span> and information on minority and historically underserved Veterans. Historically underserved Veterans includes racial and ethnic minorities (Asian American; Black or African American; Hispanic / Latino; Native American, including American Indian, Alaskan Native and Native Hawaiian; or Pacific - Islander American); LGBTQ + individuals; those determined to be underserved based on their religious beliefs and practices; those with language barriers or without citizenship status; and those in <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">rural</span> areas and on tribal lands.

<p>The PACT Act is the largest health care and benefit expansion in VA history. This law helps provide generations of Veterans (Vietnam era, Gulf War era and Post 9 / 11 era) with benefits and health care for exposure to burn pits, Agent Orange and other toxic substances. To provide insights to help ensure that implementation of the law leads to equitable outcomes for all Veterans, VA has: Supplemented its PACT Act performance dashboard to include demographics such as <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">gender</span>, <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">race</span> / <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">ethnicity</span> and age; Translated PACT ACT fact sheets into 13 languages, with additional languages in process, improving access for Veterans, their families, caregivers and survivors with preferred languages other than English; Launched VA.gov / PACT, a comprehensive public - facing resource for Veterans and their families, caregivers and survivors; Trained employees on the new law, resulting in being able to reach more Veterans; and Used PACT Act authorities to improve national <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Disaggregation_plus">rural</span> recruitment and hiring for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA); enhance the ability of VA to hire and retain staff, including health care providers, recent graduates and housekeeping aides; offer higher salaries, awards and bonuses to critical staff; and increase the amount of student loan repayment employees can receive. These new authorities resulted in nearly a 12,000 net increase of VA employees - over 7,600 of which were clinical occupations. These additional staff assisted in providing services to nearly 122,000 new enrollees and processing of over 900,000 claims. </p></article>
