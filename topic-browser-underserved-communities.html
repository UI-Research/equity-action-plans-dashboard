<p>(1) Reduce barriers to citizenship and naturalization through continued evaluation of programs, policies, and outreach opportunities. There is a significant gap between the annual naturalization rate and the annual size of the population eligible to naturalize. Commonly cited barriers to naturalization include: a lack of understanding about the naturalization process; a real or perceived inability to meet the English language requirement that is part of the naturalization process; a lack of ability to pay application fees; and a lack of understanding about reduced fees and fee waiver options. To address these barriers, USCIS will strengthen efforts to promote naturalization through citizenship education and outreach, capacity building efforts, and more streamlined naturalization application services. (2) Promote equitable use of AI technology across the Department through the development and application of new guidance as well as intra - agency coordination. With increased use of AI in carrying out DHS's homeland security mission, members of underserved communities may face disproportionate or disparate impacts, such as additional scrutiny or denial of benefits based on the potential for algorithms to operate in a manner that exhibits inappropriate biases in violation of law and DHS policy. To address these barriers, DHS will implement Department - wide policy guidance regarding the equitable use and implementation of AI technology and leverage the ongoing work of the Artificial Intelligence Task Force (AITF) and other internal working groups to establish a framework for trustworthy and responsible AI. (3) Counter domestic violent extremism (DVE) and targeted violence through a public health - informed approach. As the Department continues to tackle DVE threats, members of certain underserved communities (e.g., AMEMSA, Jewish, <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 210, 0.3)" title="LGBTQ+">LGBTQI</span> + and <span style="background-color: rgba(240, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Black">Black</span> communities) continue to have concerns about DVE threats that impact their communities. To address these barriers, DHS will build the capacity of prevention professionals, SO that they can better understand and use data - driven information on how underserved communities are often the targets and victims of domestic terrorists; </p></article>

<p>Naturalization applications and naturalizations have risen over time, but each year, only about 10 percent of eligible individuals naturalize. This trend has persisted for decades. Commonly cited barriers to naturalization include a lack of understanding about the naturalization process, a real or perceived inability to meet the English language requirement that is part of the naturalization process, a belief that the civics test is too difficult, a lack of time to prepare for the naturalization test and interview, a lack of ability to pay application fees, and a lack of understanding about reduced fees and fee waiver options. 3 About 3.5 percent of all Form N - 400s (Applications for Naturalization) are currently accompanied by at least one Form N - 648 (Medical Certification for <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Disabled">Disability</span> Exception).

<p>On January 11, 2023, USCIS hosted a national listening session on the Proposed Rule to Adjust Certain Immigration Fees. USCIS provided an overview of the proposed rule and reviewed how to submit formal comments.

" " During the engagement USCIS educated USDA staff about the barriers and challenges facing <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 30, 0.3)" title="Immigrant">immigrant</span> families in accessing federal programs and highlighted the role USCIS plays through outreach and engagements to ensure stakeholders are well informed about the Final Public Charge Rule. USCIS held stakeholder engagements on January 12, March 3, April 28, and May 31, 2023, to address questions and gather feedback on the naturalization test redesign initiative. For FY 2023, USCIS scheduled and conducted in - person Adult Citizenship Education Training in areas where there are large numbers of LPRs who are eligible to naturalize and areas that are underserved. USCIS will continue to engage with the public, including members of underserved communities; relevant stakeholders; state and local government; and other federal agencies to seek input on ways to further advance equity in applying for naturalization. As part of this effort, USCIS will utilize its expanded cadre of citizenship ambassadors to share information about the naturalization process and how to access information and support. Further, CRCL, in collaboration with USCIS / NWG, will periodically disseminate messaging regarding citizenship and naturalization initiatives to CRCL's network of community stakeholders through the GovDelivery system and monthly CRCL newsletter with an audience of over 10,000 members of the public. Additionally, CRCL, in collaboration with USCIS / NWG, will host a series of Naturalization Test Redesign Information and Listening Sessions with CRCL's network of community stakeholders.

<p>(4) Advance equity for persons who are limited English proficient by strengthening language access programs. In carrying out its varied homeland security mission, DHS encounters millions of members of the public every day, many of whom are limited English proficient (LEP) and may experience communication challenges or barriers in accessing DHS programs. Although DHS has language access policies in place, DHS has opportunities to strengthen language access across its programs and activities for persons who are LEP. Many individuals who are LEP are members of underserved communities, including racial and ethnic minority groups, individuals with <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Disabled">disabilities</span>, <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 210, 0.3)" title="LGBTQ+">LGBTQI</span> + persons, and others who face poverty or persecution. To address these barriers, DHS will apply customer experience principles and practices in advancing language access and implement the DHS Language Access Plan, updated in November 2023, and the DHS <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 120, 255, 0.3)" title="Native American">Indigenous</span> Languages Plan to ensure that the Department's language access programs are effective. (5) Advance equity in DHS's screening activities through updates to training, policy, and procedures. Members of the public, including those from underserved communities (e.g., AMEMSA communities and individuals with <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Disabled">disabilities</span>) continue to report concerns regarding their experiences when undergoing screening, including allegations of racial and ethnic profiling and improper treatment of persons with <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Disabled">disabilities</span>. To address these barriers, DHS will develop training to enhance knowledge and cultural competency of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) frontline workforce, and expand and streamline the TSA Passenger Support Specialist program, which provides previously scheduled and on - the - spot assistance to travelers who need assistance; develop a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) directive to define the roles and responsibilities of CBP offices and personnel and provide religious accommodations for members of the public during CBP - conducted services, programs, and activities; and assess and propose updates to the Department's nondiscrimination policies for external activities.

To address these barriers, DHS will conduct a review of contract opportunities and grant funding opportunity announcements prior to release to determine how equitable access for <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 120, 255, 0.3)" title="Native American">tribes</span> can be furthered; examine policy and procedures to identify updates in furtherance of security and the appropriate handling of sacred, ceremonial, or cultural items and conduct training on the same; pursue adequate staffing and other resources where needed to ensure equitable service delivery; ensure <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 120, 255, 0.3)" title="Native American">Tribal</span> representation in DHS advisory councils, committees, and other groups; and pursue modifications to service delivery, including where legislative fixes are needed. (7) Advance equity for persons seeking humanitarian protection during immigration processing by strengthening programs available to assist them. Stakeholders continue to report concerns about processing delays and access to resources. To address these barriers, USCIS will enhance processing efficiency by leveraging technology, increasing access, and seeking opportunities to reduce fees; and DHS will strengthen resources for non - detained noncitizens released on an alternative to detention program and create process efficiencies across the board. (8) Advance equity in the FEMA Individual Assistance (IA) program to increase participation of undeserved communities. In response to FEMA's 2021 Request for Information (RFI) on FEMA Programs, Regulations, and Policies and associated public meetings, members of the public suggested changes to the IA program. All relevant comments received in response to the RFI, including those received during the public meetings, have been posted to the public rulemaking docket on the Federal eRulemaking portal. To address barriers and suggested changes raised by stakeholders, FEMA will publish an Interim Final Rule (IFR) amending its regulations governing the IA program to increase equity by simplifying processes, removing barriers to entry, and increasing eligibility for certain types of assistance under the program. (9) Advance equity through Community Disaster Resilience Zones. FEMA's National Advisory Council has found that smaller, less affluent communities with fewer resources cannot access funding to appropriately prepare for a disaster, which leads to inadequate response and recovery and little opportunity for mitigation. To address this barrier, FEMA will enhance and expand Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) Program technical assistance; implement Benefit - Cost Analysis (BCA) enhancements for all relevant mitigation programs, including incorporating equity weights into BCA; and develop a Recovery and Resilience Resource Portal, which provides ideas and information on available funding opportunities for state, local, <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 120, 255, 0.3)" title="Native American">Tribal</span>, and territorial (SLTT) partners and community decision - makers. </p></article>

<p>1. Applying for Naturalization. USCIS began a comprehensive review of policies, regulations, forms, and operations to identify barriers that may impede access to naturalization by underserved communities and is undertaking efforts to reduce or eliminate those barriers. In October 2022, USCIS updated Form N - 648 (Medical Certification for <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Disabled">Disability</span> Exceptions) and related Policy Manual guidance. Applicants for naturalization with physical or developmental <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Disabled">disability</span> or mental impairments may request an exception to the English and civics testing requirements for naturalization. This form and Policy Manual update streamline the process for applicants to claim and substantiate a <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Disabled">disability</span> by eliminating unnecessary and duplicative questions. In March 2023, USCIS updated Policy Manual guidance to allow individuals requesting immigration benefits to self - select their gender marker (" " Male " " or " " <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 90, 0.3)" title="Women">Female</span> " ") without the need to provide proof of their gender identity or to match the gender listed on their supporting documentation. This update reflects an important step toward reducing administrative burdens on applicants and increasing accessibility to immigration benefits and services. 2. Accessing Humanitarian Protection During Immigration Processing. DHS improved access to humanitarian protection during immigration processing by addressing language and <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Disabled">disability</span> access gaps and enhancing access to legal information and resources. In July 2022, USCIS issued new language access guidance to ensure that LEP individuals seeking asylum who cannot be interviewed in the credible fear screening process are placed into removal proceedings where an immigration judge can apply appropriate language access safeguards as that individual seeks relief. The USCIS Language Services Branch (LSB) has prioritized reaching the most vulnerable populations, including victims of trafficking, in their languages and in a culturally appropriate manner. This work, which spanned two fiscal years and involved multiple language specialists, resulted in approximately 1,000 pages of translation.

<p>Benefit applicants, both overseas and domestic, sometimes have difficulty attending USCIS appointments when the distance needed to travel is long. There are barriers related to transportation, health and safety, and finances. In FY 2023, USCIS's Refugee, Asylum, and International Operations (RAIO) began increasing the use of video technology to conduct I - 589 asylum interviews domestically, and I - 590 refugee interviews internationally, SO that applicants living in remote locations will not have to wait SO long or travel SO far. USCIS is currently drafting a proposed rule that would codify RAIO's flexibility to conduct remote interviews with refugee applicants abroad. In March 2023, USCIS published an extension to the Asylum Interpreter Temporary Final Rule (TFR) that allowed USCIS to provide telephonic interpreters for asylum applicants who speak one of 47 listed languages through September 12, 2023. Telephonic interpreters can also be connected to video interviews SO that remote interviews can be completed. The TFR temporarily reduced barriers for asylum applicants to attend and complete their interviews. There is a significant backlog of pending petitions for U nonimmigrant status due, in part, to the annual statutory cap limiting approvals to 10,000 principal petitions per fiscal year. As this backlog of over 250,000 filings are solely filed via paper and postal mail, USCIS is considering ways to leverage technology to improve processing to provide Employment Authorization Documents and deferred action for U petitioners and their derivatives with pending filings. As noted in the U.S. National Plan to End Gender - Based Violence, <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 30, 0.3)" title="Immigrant">immigrant</span> survivors face increased barriers to economic stability. They often encounter delayed processing times when applying for special immigration remedies for GBV victims that were established through VAWA and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, such as the VAWA self - petition, the U nonimmigrant status for eligible victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and qualifying eligible crimes, and the T nonimmigrant status for eligible victims of a severe form of trafficking in persons. Delays in access to work authorization and public benefits for which an individual is potentially eligible, such as housing assistance or health care, can increase vulnerabilities to abuse and undermine recovery and healing. For refugees living in many parts of the world to access the US Refugee Admissions Program, they need to be interviewed and processed by USCIS while they are overseas, which presents many logistical and travel challenges for both the refugees and USCIS staff. When USCIS has no permanent presence in a geographic area, processing occurs when USCIS has the staff to make several international trips to complete different processing steps, thereby increasing the processing time. There are numerous steps involved in processing benefits for refugee populations, such as medical exams, refugee interviews, finalization of the decision, and assurances for placement with domestic resettlement agencies. These steps typically take place sequentially and may take a long time in between steps. Noncitizen workers are particularly vulnerable to workplace abuses including unpaid wages, discrimination, health and safety violations, and reprisals for seeking to improve working conditions. In addition, noncitizen workers are often afraid to report violations to labor enforcement agencies or participate in labor standards investigations for fear of immigration - related retaliation or threats of deportation by their employers. </p></article>

<p>In May 2022, CBP implemented an online training course titled " " <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Disabled">Disability</span> Access Training for Law Enforcement Professionals " " to educate uniformed officers and agents about their roles and responsibilities for ensuring nondiscrimination in CBP - conducted services, programs, and activities for members of the public with <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Disabled">disabilities</span>. CBP's uniformed officers and agents will be required to complete the training on a biennial basis. In January 2023, DHS announced a streamlined process for noncitizens in labor agency investigations to request deferred action consistent with Policy Statement 065 - 06, Worksite Enforcement: The Strategy to Protect the American Labor Market, the Conditions of the American Worksite, and the Dignity of the Individual. Deferred action protects noncitizen workers from threats of immigration - related retaliation from exploitative employers. These improvements advance the Biden - Harris Administration's commitment to empowering workers and improving workplace conditions by enabling all workers, including noncitizens, to assert their legal rights. 3. Bidding on a DHS Contract. DHS strengthened efforts to engage small businesses, including those owned by members of underserved communities such as <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 90, 0.3)" title="Women">women</span>, minorities, and individuals with <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Disabled">disabilities</span>, through various outreach activities. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2022, DHS exceeded all small business prime and socioeconomic goals as negotiated with the Small Business Administration, equating to $ 9 billion awarded to small businesses, including $ 4 billion to small, disadvantaged businesses. DHS is the largest spending agency to have this level of goal achievement. In FY 2022, the DHS Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) launched Small - to - Small Business Vendor Outreach Matchmaking Events (VOMEs), facilitating business - to - business meetings to encourage new entrants, explore subcontracting and teaming opportunities, and assist with decreasing gaps in small business capabilities. The VOME is another federal best practice and a first for federal OSDBU offices. Three VOMEs were held in FY 2022, garnering 1,100 registrants and nearly 800 meetings. Three VOMEs were also held in FY 2023, resulting in over 1,500 small business registrations and over 500 meetings. In FY 2023, OSDBU has hosted 10 Vendor Outreach Sessions to include four specifically reserved for underserved groups (e.g., service - <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Disabled">disabled</span> <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 180, 0.3)" title="Veterans">veteran</span> - owned, <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 90, 0.3)" title="Women">women</span> - owned, and HUBZone firms). 4.

<p>Reduce barriers to humanitarian benefits by leveraging technology, increasing access, enhancing process efficiencies, and seeking opportunities to reduce fees. Strengthen resources for non - detained noncitizens released on an alternative to detention by building on existing case management programs, like the Case Management Pilot Program, which provides case management, legal information and screening, trafficking screening, and connection to a range of social services, including pro se counsel, to noncitizens on ATD. As enumerated in DHS's National Action Plan to implement the Gender Policy Council Strategy, USCIS and ICE will work to expand access to T and U nonimmigrant statuses and VAWA protections. These benefits offer critical protection for many of our most vulnerable noncitizens - those who have been victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons and other specified crimes, and those who are victims of battery or extreme cruelty by an abusive spouse or other family member. All three benefits are crucial in stabilizing victims by providing a potential pathway to lawful permanent residence. The Department will explore how to prevent instances of domestic abuse, gender - based violence, human trafficking, and other criminal activity by raising awareness of and expanding access to potentially eligible noncitizens, including <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 90, 0.3)" title="Women">women</span> of color, who may be particularly vulnerable. USCIS leads this effort and has set goals to guide its backlog - reduction efforts.

Since July 2022, DHS has led multiple engagements focused on addressing community concerns related to DVE, Department strategy, and incidents of hate targeting specific communities. In April 2023, OPE hosted a virtual Ramadan engagement with American Muslim community leaders to solicit their feedback, concerns, and insights on DHS policies and programs. In March 2023, DHS launched the Prevention Resource Finder, providing stakeholders with information on the resources needed to help prepare for and prevent targeted violence and terrorism across our country. 5. Filing Complaints and Seeking Redress in DHS Programs and Activities. DHS continues to enhance communication with the public regarding the ability to file complaints concerning DHS programs and seek redress without retaliation, how these processes work, and what individuals can expect from these processes. OPE, CRCL, and the DHS Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO) continue to hold engagement events for the public, including underserved communities, to provide more information about the various DHS complaint processes. In March 2023, CRCL launched a new online complaint portal, with prompts available in 10 languages. The portal accepts complaints in any language and also notes the availability of interpreters and translators for any language.

<p>6. Airport Screening. In furtherance of TSA's mission to protect the Nation's transportation systems and facilitate lawful travel, TSA has enhanced and standardized training for its screening officers and has improved its screening technology capabilities to reduce the possibility of bias against travelers and increase safety. TSA deployed new Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) software for screening systems at airports across the country. This update eliminates the need for Transportation Security Officers to determine a passenger's gender prior to AIT screening and is projected to reduce the instances of enhanced screening for transgender persons and members of other underserved communities. TSA has held multiple community engagements to enhance communication with the traveling public and increase awareness of security procedures. 7. Trusted Traveler Programs. DHS has taken steps to advance equity in its Trusted Traveler Programs. TSA updated the PreCheck application process by allowing individuals to select their gender marker based on self - attestation, regardless of sex assigned at birth. The application was updated to include additional gender marker options to better serve non - binary and gender non - conforming travelers. 8. Public Assistance. FEMA has advanced equity as a foundation for public assistance. In August 2022, FEMA's Office for Public Assistance released the Operational Draft of the Public Assistance Program Delivery Guide, which included considerations for FEMA recipients and applicants to conduct response and recovery efforts in an equitable manner. The Guide includes a performance metric for the prioritization of communities rated as highly socially vulnerable, including underserved <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Rural">rural</span> areas. From April 2021 through August 2022, FEMA's Office for Equal Rights worked with the Office for Public Assistance on its mission to ensure an equitable response to the COVID - 19 pandemic. FEMA established the Civil Rights Advisory Group as part of the agency's commitment to the COVID - 19 vaccination mission amid the ongoing battle against the pandemic. The advisory group's mission is to evaluate the policies, practices, strategies, and plans in place to ensure equity in vaccine access and administration. 9. Achieving Equitable Outcomes for Disaster Survivors. FEMA continues to advance equitable outcomes for disaster survivors. FEMA is working to identify and include considerations for traditionally underserved or marginalized communities in the forms, processes, and online Grants Portal system that the agency uses to support applicants. </p></article>

<p>FEMA is redeveloping the way it collects, documents, and processes information from applicants to be less burdensome, more effective, and more equitable in the distribution of Public Assistance. Moving forward, FEMA will work to clarify the recipient's legal responsibility and to structure a more comprehensive reporting process SO that recipients and subrecipients clearly understand their obligations to develop and report on their strategies for equitable response and recovery. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) selected Recovering from a Disaster as a Life Experience Project in 2022. Discovery work was completed to inform how FEMA could create an equitable and less frustrating experience to survivors while they are enduring trauma. Based on recommendations made from the discovery work, the General Services Administration is currently partnering with FEMA to measure end - to - end burden placed on natural disaster survivors. 10. Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP). NSGP provides funding for physical security enhancements to nonprofit organizations, including houses of worship, that are at high risk of terrorist attack. FEMA has improved equitable access to NSGP funding by improving participation from nonprofit organizations serving underserved communities and embedding equity considerations in the grant review process. FEMA continues to engage in robust outreach and engagement efforts throughout the NSGP lifecycle to ensure that nonprofit organizations have the information they need to apply. In FY 2022, NSGP held 82 events, including webinars, with over 18,039 unique participants to increase understanding of the application process and eligibility for subrecipients. In June 2023, FEMA published an informative video about applying to the NSGP, available both on YouTube.com and FEMA.gov. FEMA has collaborated with other federal and nonprofit partners to further amplify this engagement and messaging, including the DHS Center for Faith - Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, Department of Justice (DOJ) Community Relations Service, religious and cultural organizations, <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 210, 255, 0.3)" title="Minority Serving Institutions">HBCUs</span>, and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 210, 255, 0.3)" title="Minority Serving Institutions">Minority Serving Institutions</span>. In FY 2023, FEMA advanced considerations of equity in awarding NSGP grant funding by adding up to 15 additional points to the scores of organizations that demonstrate how they serve an underserved community or population or that are located within an underserved community. Additionally, applicants who had never received NSGP funding had 15 points added to their project score (a scoring metric continued from FY 2022). </p></article>

<p>Geographic income inequality has risen more than 40 percent between 1980 and 2021. The richest places are pulling away, and many others - especially smaller towns and <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Rural">rural</span> areas - have fallen further behind. Rising geographic inequality suggests that economic opportunities are becoming less evenly distributed across the country and such geographic inequality risks reducing households ' ability to move to desired locations. This could concentrate economic and social challenges in certain places, or contribute to political polarization. Places with higher incomes in 1980 tended to have faster income growth between 1980 and 2021, contributing to widening geographic inequality and little change in the income ranking of places. In recent decades, faster - growing, higher - paying sectors have clustered in the same places over time, leading to increased geographic inequality. Additionally, the faster - growing, higher - paying sectors, such as tech, finance, and professional services, have become a growing share of the economy and pay high wages. </p></article>

<p>MBDA's Capital Readiness Program. On June 9, 2023, MBDA held its inaugural Capital Formation Forum to review the status of problems and programs relating to capital formation by MBEs. Participants represented various federal agencies involved in capital formation issues and addressing solutions to access to capital issues for MBEs. The discussion focused on the status of issues and programs relating to capital formation from the government's perspective and solutions for addressing these issues. MBDA Business Centers. The MBDA has entered into memoranda of agreement with Bilateral Infrastructure Law funded agencies, including the Department of Transportation and Department of Energy, designed to maximize the inclusion and growth of MBEs in federal investments, contracts, resources, and administration priorities around high - growth industries. The three top initiatives will include a National Equity Tour, Technical Assistance / Business Advisory Services, and MBE Contract Matching. These collaborations aim to close the gap in federal contracting disparity and ensure that MBEs have an equitable opportunity to participate in and benefit from federal contract opportunities. EDA's Build to Scale. EDA works with SSTI, a national nonprofit organization focused on STEM initiatives offers information and services that are needed to succeed in today's innovation economy. SSTI will host a Community of Practice (CoP) focused on technology - based economic development, through which EDA supports members of the CoP, including B2S recipients, and receives feedback on the B2S program. Outside of SSTI, EDA engages with diverse audiences at numerous conferences, webinars, and annual convenings. Lastly, EDA solicits public input on the design and implementation of the B2S program through its Customer Experience Survey. EDA incorporates this program delivery feedback in future grant competitions. USPTO's Council for Inclusive Innovation. The USPTO has been conducting in - person and virtual outreach to inventors, attorneys, and law schools to increase awareness and participation in pro bono programs and legal services programs through, for example, its " " Pathways " " events for current and aspiring entrepreneurs. These networking events connect attendees with IP protection and commercialization information and resources. In addition, the Under Secretary has sent letters to law schools throughout the country inviting them to join the USPTO Law School Clinic Certification Program. The USPTO also visited 47 law school clinics during the 2022 - 23 school year, including law school visits by Deputy Under Secretary Derrick Brent and General Counsel Dave Berdan.

<p>More than 40 percent of the U.S. population lives in coastal counties where residents are experiencing climate change in a variety of ways including more rapidly intensifying hurricanes, more severe storms, excessive heat, deepening droughts, and more frequent flooding. In the 1980s, the average time between billion - dollar climate disasters in the U.S. was 82 days; today, it is only 18 days.

<p>Past and recent research like the 2030 Census Request For Information (RFI) has documented the need for and importance of Census Bureau efforts to improve coverage rates for Historically Undercounted Populations (HUPs). For instance, in 2022, the Census Bureau released results from the Post Enumeration Survey and Demographic Analysis, which produced estimates showing that the 2020 Census undercounted some populations (e.g., the <span style="background-color: rgba(240, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Black">Black</span> or <span style="background-color: rgba(240, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Black">African American</span> population, the American Indian or Alaska <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 90, 0, 0.3)" title="Alaskan">Native</span> population living on a reservation, young children 0 to 4 years old, etc.), which underscores the value of advancing research to help the Census Bureau accurately count and describe HUPs. Al systems can reflect and amplify systemic and human biases present in the organizations and communities that develop, deploy, and use them. AI systems can also manifest statistical and computational biases. This can cause them to underperform for some groups relative to others, as in facial recognition, or to treat groups differently. Studies have shown that these phenomena have led to disparate outcomes in employment, housing, credit scoring, health care, and finance. Some private sector actors as well as public regulators have indicated the need to adjust their work in response to Al - related bias and discrimination. </p></article>

The Regional Initiative will also help identify the strengths and weaknesses of regional economies, uncover new opportunities for growth, provide insights into local economic needs, and maximize the impact of regional investments. <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 90, 0.3)" title="Women">Women</span> in the Labor Force. OUSEA launched a new dashboard that provides monthly updates of data on <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 90, 0.3)" title="Women">women</span> in the labor force alongside the Bureau of Labor Statistics ' monthly release on the employment situation. Over the next year, the OUSEA will update the monthly reporting on <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 90, 0.3)" title="Women">women</span> in particular industries - especially those undergoing rapid changes due to legislative or environmental factors. 5.3 Further equitable access to data for Puerto Rico. The Census Bureau seeks to empower decision - makers, businesses, researchers, and the public with timely, accurate, reliable, and meaningful data for Puerto Rico. The Census Bureau is furthering equitable access to data in several ways: Establish a Federal Statistical Research Data Center (FSRDC) in Puerto Rico. The FSRDC will provide the opportunity to understand better the economic, health, and social conditions affecting the Commonwealth, which would enhance the ability of federal and local officials to make decisions. Additionally, providing the Puerto Rican research community equitable access to the wealth of federal restricted - use data available through the FSRDC network will help develop statistical capacity and collaboration building on the island; Leverage data for disaster recovery. The Community Resilience Estimates (CRE) for Puerto Rico will show the social vulnerability in Puerto Rico in the event of a disaster. Using restricted microdata from the 2019 Puerto Rico Community Survey (PRCS) and small area modeling, the CRE creates population estimates based on ten individual / household level risk factors, including: poverty status, number of caregivers in the households, unit - level crowding, educational attainment, employment, <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Disabled">disability</span> status, health insurance coverage, age (65 +), vehicle access, and broadband internet access; Establish an annual Puerto Rico Economic Survey.

<p>Creation of NIST's generative AI profile for the Risk Management Framework. NIST established the National Al Advisory Committee (NAIAC), a group of experts tasked with advising the President and the National Al Initiative Office on topics related to Al. This includes matters related to the use of Al in law enforcement and legal standards, such as those ensuring that Al use is consistent with privacy rights, civil rights and civil liberties, and <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Disabled">disability</span> rights. NIST intends to develop a generative Al profile for the Risk Management Framework to help entities apply the framework to the creation of new, advanced generative Al models. Address harmful biases throughout the AI system lifecycle. In May, NIST and NSF launched the Institute for Trustworthy Al in Law and Society (TRAILS), a partnership between the University of Maryland, George Washington, and Morgan State University. NIST and NSF will invest $ 20 million over five years for TRAILS to focus on how ethics and human rights can drive Al development and governance. Importantly, a key pillar of TRAILS will be input and feedback from marginalized communities. </p></article>

<p>The most persistent barrier to the establishment, expansion, and growth of minority business enterprises (MBEs) continues to be access to capital. The U.S. Federal Reserve found that more than half of <span style="background-color: rgba(240, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Black">Black</span> - owned businesses were turned down for private bank loans, a rate twice as high as white business owners. A Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies study found that 6 in 10 <span style="background-color: rgba(240, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Black">Black</span> business owners faced challenges obtaining capital. Over a third of <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 120, 0.3)" title="Latinx">Latino</span> business owners faced the same. Business owners of color were more likely to struggle to access startup funding, growth funding, and capital with affordable interest rates.

According to the USPTO, that increase in inventorship would grow our economy and GDP by an estimated $ 1 trillion. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, fewer than 1 percent of minority - owned businesses export goods or services. For these enterprises, insufficient financial resources often hinder their ability to invest in overseas market exploration, navigate regulatory complexities, and establish international networks. </p></article>

<p>Building innovation: In June 2023, NTIA announced funding allocations for the $ 42.45 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program. BEAD funding will be used to deploy or upgrade broadband networks to ensure everyone in America has access to reliable, affordable, high - speed internet service. Once deployment goals are met, any remaining funding can be used to pursue eligible access, adoption, and equity - related uses. Announced in June and September 2023, NTIA's Middle Mile (MM) program provided nearly a billion dollars in grants across 36 organizations across 40 states and territories to support the construction, improvement, or acquisition of middle - mile infrastructure, reduce the cost of bringing high - speed internet to unserved and underserved communities, and increase the resilience of internet infrastructure. Lastly, the purpose of the Broadband Infrastructure Program (BIP) is to build partnerships between states and internet service providers to expand internet access to areas without service, especially <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Rural">rural</span> areas.

Progress on addressing gaps in data collection to facilitate data - informed decision - making. Office of Management, Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) OAM implemented an agency - wide BIL funding opportunity announcement (FOA) template for BIL and IRA actions to further the Administration's goals to advance equity, provide support for disadvantaged communities, and leverage federal resources to achieve these objectives. The FOA template includes a Community Benefits Plan requirement, along with requirements to collect equity and justice - focused data. OAM, the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU), and the National Nuclear Safety Administration are co - leading an Acquisition Forecast Improvement Working Group to establish a centralized, web - based platform capturing all contracting, subcontracting and financial assistance opportunities at DOE and better reach underrepresented businesses in DOE procurement opportunities. ii.

Office of Management, OAM OAM implemented a strategy with M & O contractors and major site and facility contractors designed to increase subcontracting opportunities from contractors who employ people who are blind or have significant <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Disabled">disabilities</span> (AbilityOne). As a result of this implementation, DOE - wide AbilityOne obligations increased from $ 27.5M in FY 2022 to $ 31.2M in FY 2023, an increase of 13 %. OAM continues to co - lead the Innovative Funding Mechanisms Working Group with the Office of General Counsel, which is exploring innovative mechanisms to increase participation in DOE funding opportunities. The Working Group has focused on Partnership Intermediary Agreements (PIAs) and Other Transactions (OT) Authority as possible pathways to reach underrepresented entities and communities. PIAs are best utilized when traditional contractual mechanisms do not provide adequate outreach with non - traditional contractors and can reduce barriers to entry for such entities. DOE has put a Pilot PIA agreement in place to extend the Department's reach to new entrants and non - traditional partners, as well as small business firms, universities, and non - profit organizations. The agency has awarded one project utilizing the PIA mechanism, and additional projects are in the planning phase. Additionally, the agency has developed an OT guide for DOE program offices to increase the utilization of OT Authorities department wide. The agency anticipates that these interventions will increase contracting opportunities with new entrants and non - traditional partners. OAM undertook an initiative in the Office of Headquarters Procurement Services to utilize market research tools such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise - Wide Procurement Provider Lookup Tool, Small Business </p></article>

The clean energy revolution must lift up communities that have been overburdened by pollution and excluded from economic prosperity, and ensure they participate fully in the benefits of the Department's historic investments in clean energy. From the households grappling with issues of energy - related pollution and energy insecurity, to the universities advancing basic research with Department funds, and the businesses and community - based organizations that partner with DOE to deliver on its mission, the Department has an extraordinary reach. To fulfill this mission, DOE must embed equity throughout its policies and programs. </p></article>

<p>Currently, DOE lacks a department - wide strategic framework for community engagement. Over the past year, the Justice40 Stakeholder Engagement Community of Practice (Justice40 SE CoP) and Office of Community Engagement (OCE) teams have completed internal assessments to understand Departmental approaches to stakeholder engagement. The Justice40 SE CoP and OCE teams found a lack of an agency - wide framework, which has caused inconsistencies in distributing resources such as technical assistance, funding, and other support mechanisms to underserved communities. Additionally, uncoordinated outreach often means duplicate communications to some <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 120, 255, 0.3)" title="Native American">Tribal</span> and community entities and no outreach to others. Further, the lack of a formal feedback process fails to incorporate <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 120, 255, 0.3)" title="Native American">Tribal</span> Nations and community voices in program design and decision - making. To remediate these deficiencies, DOE will develop an agency - wide " " ground game " " to fully engage community entities and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 120, 255, 0.3)" title="Native American">Tribes</span>. </p></article>

New entrants to the Federal procurement process lack experience and understanding of how to access opportunities and the various methods that DOI uses to procure goods and services. Communication. During DOI's listening sessions, participants indicated frustration with the communication between the Department and vendors, including identifying the appropriate individuals within Bureaus to help them, response rates, and obtaining information about specific opportunities before and after award. In addition, outreach - especially in - person outreach - can be limited by geography and established networks, which may also present barriers for some businesses. Process Complexity. During DOI's listening sessions, participants provided input regarding the complexity of the procurement process, with each step governed by statute and regulations that may differ from commercial contracting. It can be particularly challenging for new or inexperienced businesses to understand requirements, terms and conditions in solicitations, and other elements of the process. Limited opportunities to gain experience and / or training on the process may present barriers to some businesses. Departmental Procedures. Ensuring Departmental processes and policies contribute to an equitable distribution of awards to underserved communities is a critical component to achieving equity in Federal procurement. Based on the barriers identified above - awareness of procurement opportunities and communication with vendors - preliminary review of DOI policy, feedback from listening sessions, and survey results, the Department identified the following process and policy as a focus area for additional targeted review and analysis: Publicizing procurement actions. Communication with vendors throughout the acquisition process, such as communication with vendors who were unsuccessful at securing an award during debriefing. </p></article>

<p>Modify the way existing programs are implemented to emphasize the importance of delivering benefits to underserved communities and design new programs equitably, which will ensure that a greater portion of funds flow to those communities. Examples include: For the ORLP, NPS specified the following criteria for emphasis to be considered in the evaluation of proposals for awards in FY 2023: (1) environmental justice, (2) urban heat map areas, and (3) military outdoor recreation. The LWCF State Assistance Program provides grants to States to support the acquisition of land and the development of facilities for public outdoor recreation. The NPS - revised LWCF State Manual, which lays out the requirements for State participation in the program, asks States to be more intentional in selecting LWCF projects that are in alignment with Justice40 Initiative goals and direct States to use the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool in project selection. In order for States to participate in the LWCF program, they must prepare a Statewide Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan that outlines how they will implement the program. The NPS will also ask States, through their quinquennial updates, to include underserved communities as they identify recreation issues of Statewide importance and the actions States will take to address them. In implementing the BIL AML Program, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement is encouraging States and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 120, 255, 0.3)" title="Native American">Tribes</span> to prioritize projects that invest in communities marginalized, underserved, and overburdened by pollution, consistent with the President's Justice40 Initiative.

<p>Revise Departmental and Bureau policies to make environmental justice considerations an essential part of the decision - making process, which will help shape program development and implementation to have a greater focus on environmental justice. Examples include: Update the Department's environmental justice policy as stated in the Departmental Manual to reflect EO 14008, entitled " " Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad " " and EO 14096, entitled " " Revitalizing Our Nations Commitment to Environmental Justice for All. " " Create guidance documents for the use of science and data in environmental decision - making to incorporate data related to environmental justice and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 120, 255, 0.3)" title="Native American">Indigenous</span> Knowledge, along with an environmental justice science and data integrated decision model. This work, which helps address the Department's priority learning question: " " How well does DOI collect and document traditional knowledge that informs decisions?

The BLM issued an " " Instruction Memorandum about Environmental Justice Implementation " " and " " Addressing Environmental Justice in NEPA FAQs " " in September 2022. These documents update and formalize best practices while recommending methods for scoping, outreach, and analysis in environmental reviews. These policies will help guide BLM staff in implementing environmental justice and Justice40 Initiative and will serve as examples for other Bureaus to develop policies. Expand outreach and assistance efforts to better meet the needs of underserved communities. Priority learning question 4.4 in the Department's FY 2022 - 2026 Learning Agenda asked, " " How can the Department increase stakeholder engagement to improve environmental justice outcomes for infrastructure investments? " " Examples include: Develop a stakeholder relationship management platform to reduce stakeholder fatigue and help staff across the Department learn about the needs communities identify during engagements and consultations. This will lead to more equitable outcomes by increasing the effectiveness and usefulness of engagements. Provide technical assistance for grant writing and grant writers, which we have learned from listening sessions and public comment is an important tool for reducing the barriers to participating in funding opportunities. Work with on - the - ground partners that can help guide and direct our outreach to communities who need it most. For example, the Office of <span style="background-color: rgba(60, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Hawaiian">Native Hawaiian</span> Relations has been working with certain <span style="background-color: rgba(60, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Hawaiian">Native Hawaiian</span> Organizations (NHOs) that have facilitated outreach to other NHOs and portions of the community that have not historically applied for or received funding from the Department due to capacity issues or other barriers to participation. This outreach helps inform program design to reach those communities. Use funding provided in the Inflation Reduction Act for outreach regarding permitting environmental reviews and authorizations to perform stakeholder and community engagement, with emphasis on enabling underserved communities to be part of the decision - making process.

The Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) modified the evaluation criteria for WaterSMART grants to encourage projects that directly benefit disadvantaged communities and support climate change resiliency. The NPS announced $ 192 million in funding for the LWCF - Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership Program (ORLP), which enables urban, disadvantaged communities to (1) create new outdoor recreation spaces, (2) reinvigorate existing parks, and (3) form connections between people and the outdoors in such communities. As part of the notice of funding opportunity, NPS modified the evaluation criteria in ORLP grants to encourage States to submit projects focused on environmental justice, addressing heat islands, and support for recreation outside of military facilities. The NPS also created two deadlines for the grant - January 23, 2023, and May 31, 2023 - to encourage States to submit more grants.

<p>A. 2022 Equity Action Plan Update Pursuant to EO 13985, 2 the Department of Justice published its first ever Equity Action Plan in April 2022. Since then, the Department has made significant progress implementing its equity priorities by improving solicitation processes, increasing opportunities for disadvantaged small businesses located in Historically Underutilized Business Zones, and strengthening mechanisms for community engagement, among others. Specific examples of the Department's ongoing progress in advancing its 2022 equity priorities include: Strengthening efforts to ensure compliance and enforcement of non - discrimination laws. Following review of implementation and administrative enforcement of the non - discrimination provisions set forth in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act ³ and the Safe Streets Act4 in connection with Federal financial assistance, the Department is taking affirmative steps to improve this work. 5 For example, the Civil Rights Division (CRT) and the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) created and co - chair a Compliance Working Group to coordinate the implementation and enforcement of these statutes, issue public guidance, revise internal standards, update tools and resources, and conduct public outreach. 6 Enhancing language access for individuals with limited English proficiency.

For example, DOJ recently published its FY 2022 - 2026 Strategic Plan in Spanish and key excerpts were published in Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, and Tagalog. In August 2023, the Department also released its updated Language Access Plan, which improves translation and interpretation services, promotes quality assurance of those services, and expands the range of tools available to serve the public. The Department has made significant progress in advancing environmental justice as measured through the agency's performance on the Environmental Justice Scorecard. This progress includes: (1) analyzing how to best enforce the non - discrimination provisions under Title VI; (2) prioritizing environmental justice in DOJ's decision - making processes through the creation of the Office of Environmental Justice (OEJ), development and implementation of a new Comprehensive Environmental Justice Enforcement Strategy, and engagement with communities with environmental justice concerns, including <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 120, 255, 0.3)" title="Native American">Tribal</span> nations; and (3) institutionalizing environmental justice by developing DOJ resources and training, increasing staff capacity, and strengthening </p></article>

<p>Law enforcement leaders acknowledge the importance of increasing racial, ethnic, language, and gender diversity in their agencies. But hiring and promotional assessments, internal processes, recruitment strategies, and organizational policies can exacerbate the lack of diversity in the ranks by failing to adequately capture the value of and sufficiently meet the unique needs of officers from diverse backgrounds. For example, <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 90, 0.3)" title="Women">women</span> officers are significantly underrepresented, making up over just 12 % of sworn officers and 3 % of law enforcement leaders. 39 Federal, State, and local agencies often lack the support and resources necessary to attract, hire, and retain a qualified and diverse workforce. </p></article>

<p>In 2020, the Department of Labor's Women's Bureau (WB) collaborated with the U.S. Census Bureau to conduct the most comprehensive analysis of the gender wage gap to date. The analysis shows that the majority of the gap between men and women's wages cannot be explained through measurable differences between workers, such as age, education, work history, industry, occupation, or work hours, but is more likely the result of occupational and industrial segregation. Additional studies show that providing caregiving activities to children and adults with care needs, of which <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 90, 0.3)" title="Women">women</span> are disproportionately responsible, impose substantial lifetime economic costs; and during economic strife, like the COVID - pandemic, subsets of <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 90, 0.3)" title="Women">women</span> have experienced slower recovery in comparison to their male counterparts. </p></article>

<p>1. Improve college access, affordability, and degree completion for underserved students to increase economic mobility. The Department aims to address barriers to college access, affordability, and completion by supporting colleges to enroll more students from underserved groups, including <span style="background-color: rgba(60, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="POC">students of color</span>, students from low - income backgrounds, students who are English learners, and others to raise graduation rates and close graduation rate gaps for these student populations, and offer affordable credentials of value that lead to careers offering economic mobility. 2. Implement Maintenance of Equity requirements to ensure historically underserved students have equitable resources for learning recovery. The Department aims to ensure that school districts serving historically underserved student groups, including <span style="background-color: rgba(60, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="POC">students of color</span>, students from low - income backgrounds, students who are English learners, students experiencing homelessness, and others have the resources they need to support learning recovery. This includes the allocation of $ 122 billion in ARP funds for Title I schools, and the ARP's Maintenance of Equity requirements to protect high poverty schools from reductions in State and local education funding. 3. Address inequities faced by justice - impacted individuals by expanding access to postsecondary learning opportunities that improve outcomes for communities and reduce recidivism rates. The Department aims to ensure that our society is more just and equitable through supporting better opportunities for education during periods of incarceration and post - release. Current initiatives are set to improve the well - being of people who are incarcerated and increase successful reentry outcomes, smoothing pathways to further education, increasing workforce readiness and engagement, and reducing recidivism and preventing crime. This includes the partnerships that exist between institutions of higher education, correctional agencies, accrediting agencies, and community - based organizations. 4. Advance equity in and through career and technical education. The Department aims to invest in career and technical education to create new and inclusive pathways to well - paying jobs and upward mobility. This includes leveraging data to promote strategies that reduce segregation by gender, race, and ethnicity in high school career and technical education (CTE) programs. 5. Increase mental health resources with an emphasis on underserved communities, from the historic legislation and funding provided by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. </p></article>

<p>1. Prioritized college access and college completion as accessibility, affordability, equitable funding, and verification remain barriers to postsecondary education. Improved Accessibility: In the wake of the Supreme Court ruling last summer limiting the ability of colleges to consider an applicant's race in and of itself as a factor in deciding whether to admit an applicant, the Department provided colleges and universities with resources on what admissions practices and programs remain lawful to ensure diversity, convened a National Summit on Educational Opportunity, and released a report on strategies for increasing diversity and educational opportunity. The Department also awarded over $ 40 million in Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) and TRIO Upward Bound grants in FY23 for programs focused on helping low - income students, first - generation students, and students with <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Disabled">disabilities</span> gain access to college. Improved Affordability: The Department worked to secure a $ 500 hundred increase in the maximum Pell Grant award, the largest increase in 10 years, in the FY23 Omnibus Appropriations bill and awarded $ 22 million in grants to colleges to address students ' basic needs, including food, housing, transportation, and childcare earlier this fiscal year.

These trends of criminal justice system involvement and incarceration represent a serious and stubborn set of challenges to equal and equitable participation in high - quality education by all segments of society. Educational attainment of people who are incarcerated or confined and justice - impacted learners is incredibly important. Unfortunately, many people in prison lack the education and workforce skills they need to succeed in the labor market. Fifty - eight percent of people who are incarcerated do not complete an education program while in prison. 24 Limited - skilled individuals caught up in the incarceration cycle may not be able to access educational programs. Given that education is an important determinant of social and economic well - being, 25 it is critical to reconnect this population to educational opportunities.

<p>Promote greater transparency about student participation in CTE. For the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 (Perkins V), which distributes $ 1.4 billion annually to states to support and improve CTE at the secondary and postsecondary levels, the Department collects data from states on student participation in CTE programs within 16 career clusters that are disaggregated by race, ethnicity, gender, and " " special population " " status. 35 These data have previously been disseminated as large static tables that have made it difficult to identify patterns of segregation and underrepresentation by students with different demographic characteristics. The Department will begin to supplement these tables with a dynamic, web - based data dashboard that will make clear the extent to which there is underrepresentation in different program areas by race, ethnicity, gender, and " " special population " " status at the national and state levels. Investigate collecting more data to support intersectional analyses. The Department will hold listening sessions with representatives of state agencies, civil rights organizations, and other stakeholders to explore expanding its collection of data on student participation in CTE by career cluster to data that are disaggregated by gender within each major racial and ethnic group and " " special population " " to support intersectional analyses. Participation data are now disaggregated by gender, race, ethnicity, and " " special population " " status only. Highlight state progress in reducing segregation by gender.

The Department implemented Maintenance of Equity ARP Elementary and Secondary School Relief (ESSER) requirements to ensure historically underserved students have the State and local resources necessary for continued recovery. The Department provided guidance, including weekly technical assistance calls with State educational agencies (SEAs) and educational materials, including frequently asked questions (FAQs), optional reporting templates, and webinars, and other targeted supports to States to promote continued equitable investment of State and local resources in K - 12 education in high - poverty communities. The Department continues to work with States to provide technical assistance in using historic investments in Title I, now totaling $ 19 billion annually, along with other permissible funding sources to sustain key activities funded by ARP; this includes increasing academic achievement, supporting students ' mental health, expanding access to preschool, and strengthening teacher recruitment and retention. The Department continues to collect per - pupil and full time equivalent (FTE) staff data from States on the LEAs and schools they have identified as serving the highest proportion of students in poverty in FY19 - 23. 3. Invested in resources to help advance civil rights to identify inequities in educational opportunities as the country grappled with the COVID - 19 pandemic and its effects on students ' academic, social, and emotional development. </p></article>

Advanced equity in grant process strategies through funding programs that focused on improving access to high - quality educational opportunities and programs that pursue innovations in teaching and learning with an emphasis on underserved students. Designated the $ 1 billion from the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA) as the Stronger Connections Grant Program. This enables SEAs to competitively award subgrants to high - need LEAs for activities to support safe and healthy students under ESEA section 4108. Funded 264 grants with $ 1 billion in BSCA funds to more than 40 states to increase the supply of school - based mental health professionals under the School - Based Mental Health Services Grant and the Mental Health Services Professional Demonstration (MHSPD) Grant Program. At least 40 States used " " high poverty " " in their definition of high - needs school. The Department estimates these 5 - year grants will result in an increase of 14,000 mental health professionals.

<p>In March 2022, reached a settlement with Chevron Phillips Chemical Company to install and operate air pollution controls at three petrochemical manufacturing facilities in Texas located in areas of environmental justice concern; monitoring results will be publicly posted, and corrective actions are required if emissions exceed certain thresholds. Took aggressive, early enforcement actions in communities with environmental justice concerns: In August 2022, following negotiations that considered concerns voiced by the local community, secured a preliminary injunction for the Toa Alta Municipal Solid Waste Landfill to take immediate action to address urgent human health and environmental concerns. Issued two Clean Air Act emergency orders to shut down the Limetree Refinery in the U.S. Virgin Islands (June 2021) where residents were sickened by excess sulfur and hydrogen sulfide emissions and to cut hydrogen sulfide emissions from the New Indy plant in South Carolina (May 2021). Provided more enforcement information to communities about facilities, pollution, and enforcement activities through press releases, desk statements, public meetings, and websites focused on specific communities and incidents (e.g., Refinery on St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, H2S in South and North Carolina, Toa Alta Landfill in Puerto Rico). Increased efforts to obtain input from communities on potential remedies prior to finalizing settlement agreements. Developed analytical approaches to address environmental justice implications of major regulatory proposals and final rules. For example, For the Oil and Natural Gas New Source Performance Standard proposal (November 2021) and the Supplemental Proposal (November 2022), EPA held virtual trainings (900 + participants) marketed to communities with environmental justice concerns and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 120, 255, 0.3)" title="Native American">Tribes</span> to assist their ability to understand and comment meaningfully on the proposal. EPA's proposal included requirements for states to undertake meaningful outreach and engagement with communities with environmental justice concerns as they develop their plans for regulating existing oil and gas sources under the emissions guidelines. In the final nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission standards for trucks, conducted analyses of the number and demographics of the populations living within close proximity to truck freight routes. This final rule will likely result in widespread air quality improvements across the U.S., especially in areas already overburdened by air pollution and diesel emissions, beginning with model year 2027. In July 2023, issued proposed rules to strengthen lead paint standards to protect against childhood lead exposure. Developed a Strategy to Reduce Lead Exposures and Disparities in US Communities to advance EPA's work to protect the public from lead with an emphasis on high - risk communities. Announced the allotment of $ 2.865B FY 2023 funds from the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund for identification and replacement of lead service lines (LSLs). As part of the Lead Service Line Replacement (LSLR) Accelerators, EPA and 4 state partners are working with 40 communities to address existing barriers and accelerate progress towards LSL identification and replacement. The new Accelerator provides targeted technical assistance services to help communities with environmental justice concerns access funds from President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law4 and this initiative will prioritize benefits to communities with EJ concerns and promote equity. Provided Spanish Lead Awareness Curriculum for Indian Country. </p></article>

<p>EPA continues to prioritize removing barriers faced by communities with environmental justice concerns accessing technical assistance and resources. Our belief as stated in our FY 2022 Equity Action Plan remains true today: communities with environmental justice concerns and other overburdened communities are often deeply affected by environmental policymaking. Yet these communities with environmental justice concerns can face multiple resource and capacity challenges to engaging with EPA or accessing its programs and resources. These communities often have experienced decades of chronic underinvestment and frequently lack capacity to engage in decision - making processes, prepare competitive proposals, or manage federal awards. EPA and other federal partners may fail to coordinate funding and assistance programs, thereby transferring the burden of identifying and coordinating complementary programs onto the already capacity - constrained community. These barriers most affect communities that are smaller; have faced decades of disinvestment and overburden; are economically or otherwise disadvantaged; have limited English proficiency or populations with <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Disabled">disabilities</span> that prevent full access to meetings and information; and / or lack access to digital infrastructure. </p></article>

<p>Although technology continues to rapidly evolve, persistent inequities in technology design and delivery - like higher false rejection rates, completion failure rates, and time burdens - disproportionately negatively impact those from historically and socially marginalized communities. Additionally, digital services very often fail to prioritize human - centered design and usability beyond compliance. This means that Americans who likely have a critical need to connect with government information and services through digital platforms also are likely to have the hardest time doing SO. Examples include both lack of access to the newest hardware or good internet, which often means newer digital platforms do not perform as well (because they are not built for <span style="background-color: rgba(240, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Senior">older</span> devices or don't work with low bandwidth connections), or software that is not designed to work across all populations, such as lack of plain language impacting populations with limited English proficiency or poorly trained Al models causing biometric systems to perform worse for people with different ages or skin tones. GSA - through its consulting and fellowships offerings such as the Centers of Excellence and the Presidential Innovation Fellows, shared services such as Login.gov and the US Web Design System, and Federal partners in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and United States Digital Service - plays a central role in the responsible development, deployment, and procurement of technologies used by the Federal Government to communicate or interact with the public. 4 GSA is committed to delivering high - impact digital services and products in a manner that improves customer experience, reduces burden, broadens access, and advances civic tech practices that are intrinsically equity - aware and community - informed. </p></article>

Our actions will address gaps in insurance coverage and the birthing care infrastructure to ensure better maternal health outcomes. Meeting Behavioral Health Needs: The impact of the COVID - 19 pandemic increased mental health and substance use challenges for all populations, but disproportionately exacerbated the already existing behavioral health disparities among underserved racial, ethnic, and sexual minority populations. The rising rates of suicide, depression, anxiety, and substance misuse among youth and adults are impacted by a decreasing workforce, limited resources, underinsurance, and lack of culturally competent care. Our actions will improve access to behavioral health care coverage and ensure that prevention and treatment are accessible and meet the needs of all populations. Advancing Clinical Innovation: To increase our understanding of what treatments are most effective for which populations, we need to increase the diversity of our research and clinical trials to inform that science. Our actions will engage a more diverse set of populations in informing our efforts and participating in clinical research so that we can innovate to improve health and well - being outcomes. </p></article>

Lack of diversity in clinical research has the potential to hinder innovation. Including populations that have been underrepresented in clinical trials and medical studies can help researchers better understand variation in the safety and effectiveness of interventions, identify new biological processes, and lead to new discoveries that can benefit other populations. 55 Evidence from clinical studies help inform health recommendations, insurance coverage, and reimbursement of healthcare services. Without representation of specific groups in trials and studies, we may lack confidence about how new therapeutics will impact all populations. A lack of representation in clinical studies can impede access to effective medical interventions for underrepresented groups if they are not included to build the evidence base to begin with. 56 56 Additional barriers contributing to underrepresentation of racial and ethnic minority patients ' participation in clinical trials include mistrust or fear and stigma of participation, lack of comfort with the clinical trial process, lack of information about clinical trials, time and resource constraints associated with clinical trial participation, and lack of clinical trial awareness. 57 </p></article>

As detailed within this Equity Action Plan, HUD will enact a dedicated training curriculum to national fair housing partners to ensure that knowledge of Fair Housing protections is widespread and actionable in local communities.

HUD will evaluate the effectiveness of the Moving To Work (MTW) expansion's asset - building cohort and application of lessons learned to future HUD program design. MTW is a demonstration program for PHAs that provides them the opportunity to design and test innovative, locally designed strategies that use Federal dollars more efficiently, help residents find employment and become self - sufficient, and increase housing choices for low - income families. This cohort of the MTW Expansion will evaluate policies that seek to encourage savings and improve credit for assisted households. HUD is continuing to refine the loss mitigation options available to help borrowers who fall behind on their mortgage payments to get back on track and preserve homeownership. HUD will maximize homeownership for creditworthy first - time homebuyers and preserve homeownership for existing homeowners. Historical data collected from the FHA Annual Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund report, has shown that FHA has consistently maintained an 80 percent or above single - family purchase endorsement for borrowers that are first - time homebuyers. This report has also shown that FHA has maintained a sub 30 percent re - default rate after a loss mitigation action. To continue this trend and improve these metrics, HUD will maximize homeownership for creditworthy first - time homebuyers and preserve homeownership for existing homeowners. By September 30, 2025, HUD will maintain a first - time homebuyer rate of at least 80 % for newly endorsed FHA - insured purchase mortgages and a re - default rate for seriously delinquent homeowners who received a loss mitigation action that is below 30 %. </p></article>

HUD and FHAP agencies consistently receive more than 10,000 complaints per year (11,741 in FY 2022), with <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Disabled">disability</span> as the most common basis for alleged discrimination, followed by race and sex. For more than 40 years, HUD's Housing Discrimination studies have documented the persistence of housing discrimination among protected classes. For example, HUD's 2017 study of Rental Housing Discrimination on the Basis of Mental <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Disabled">Disabilities</span> found that individuals with mental illness and intellectual or developmental <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Disabled">disabilities</span> experienced significant levels of adverse differential treatment in the rental market, including being less likely to receive a response to their inquiries and less likely to be told a unit was available. A 2021 study of Housing Discrimination Against Same - Sex Couples and Transgender Individuals found that housing providers treated lesbians comparably to heterosexual <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 90, 0.3)" title="Women">women</span> seeking rental housing, told gay men about fewer available rental units than they told heterosexual men, and told transgender testers about fewer units than they told cisgender home seekers. The pervasive use of criminal background checks during tenant screening can create a barrier to renting housing, even though that information may be incomplete or inaccurate and information about past criminal history is not necessarily a reliable predictor of housing success. Studies have also found that <span style="background-color: rgba(240, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Black">Black</span> and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 120, 0.3)" title="Latinx">Hispanic</span> communities, are disproportionately affected by tenant screening practices that include a criminal background check. A growing body of evidence shows that the provision of housing assistance, particularly when accompanied with supportive services, can help reduce recidivism and decrease involvement in the criminal justice system, thereby strengthening public safety. HUD's forthcoming study of the Housing Needs of Survivors of Human Trafficking finds that survivors of human trafficking and those at risk of trafficking, both highly vulnerable populations, face substantial hurdles in finding affordable housing related to landlord screening for criminal background, credit history, and rental history. </p></article>

Research into the cause of the affordable housing shortage finds that the biggest impediment to building more affordable housing is the availability and cost of land; thus addressing the costs and constraints of developing land is a key step to improving equity. Restrictive land use and zoning laws are major drivers of the national housing shortage preventing development of moderately priced housing stock and driving up prices and rents. Land use and zoning restrictions also have long been used to reinforce racial, ethnic, and class - based segregation. As costs increase and housing options narrow, <span style="background-color: rgba(240, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Black">Black</span> and Brown households experience longer commutes, less access to resources and opportunities, and greater housing instability.

<p>A large body of literature has investigated the relationship between environmental toxins, race, and poverty. Most notably, the 1987 landmark study by Robert Bullard " " Toxic Waste and Race in the United States " " that demonstrated a correlation between the placement of toxic waste facilities and low - income <span style="background-color: rgba(240, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Black">Black</span> and Brown communities Since then, several studies from interdisciplinary approaches continue to asses environmental injustices as demonstrated in Environmental Justice: The Economics of Race, Place, and Pollution or seen in the legacies from redlining and pollution. Researcher Diana Hernandez demonstrates in two papers how weatherization can be a catalyst for reducing the energy burden affecting low - income individuals and ultimately improve health and social outcomes among African Americans. Through the publications Climate Justice Starts at Home: Building Resilient Housing to Reduce Disparate Impacts From Climate Change in Residential Settings and Energy efficiency as energy justice: addressing racial inequities through investments in people and places she finds that <span style="background-color: rgba(240, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Black">Black</span> households, even when disaggregating income, are more likely to live in less - efficient homes, demonstrating the legacy of housing segregation, redlining, and lack of equitable access to financing. These additional energy costs affect utility costs. She poses not just utility assistance but weatherization and green energy improvements as mechanisms to reducing environmental and economic injustices. To complement the body of literature on this topic, the White House Council on Environmental Quality developed the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST) using nationally consistent data and an approach that combines environmental and demographic indicators to identify historically disadvantaged communities through an interactive map. The tool measures burdens in eight categories: climate change, energy, health, housing, legacy pollution, transportation, water and wastewater, and workforce development. Individuals seeking careers in the green construction industry often face barriers in accessing training opportunities (including apprenticeships) to become certified and / or qualified for the employment opportunities. The Center for Law and Social Policy asserts that " " <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 90, 0.3)" title="Women">women</span>, people with <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Disabled">disabilities</span>, youth, and people impacted by the criminal legal system face especially egregious hiring discrimination and inequitable employment opportunities " " and that green investments can create high quality employment opportunities. </p></article>

<p>In August 2022, HUD released an economic justice agenda outlining actions the Agency will take to help low - income renters develop credit, save resources for homeownership, access housing counseling, and build wealth. Secretary Fudge has noted that this economic justice agenda is part of HUD's efforts to address systemic racism and to better include and serve those who are historically underserved by government. The agenda aims to help HUD - assisted renters take critical steps toward financial well - being and potential homeownership through saving, credit building, and banking. In July 2023, HUD released a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) for $ 126 million for the Family Self - Sufficiency (FSS) program to help HUD - assisted families increase earned income and improve their financial stability. The FSS Program advances equity in the rental assistance portfolio by utilizing HUD - assisted housing as a platform to improve the lives of residents. <span style="background-color: rgba(240, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Black">Black</span> and Brown peopleare overrepresented in HUD - assisted housing, and the majority of FSS participants are <span style="background-color: rgba(240, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Black">Black</span>, <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 120, 0.3)" title="Latinx">Latino</span>, and <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="AAPI">Asian</span>. FSS provides a critical link between HUD - assisted residents and community partners who enhance the quality of life of residents with childcare, transportation, basic adult education, job training, employment counseling, substance / alcohol abuse treatment, financial empowerment, asset building skills, and homeownership counseling. This funding opportunity allows for the Agency to seek new FSS programs for residents in public, voucher, and multifamily housing, by adding additional grant opportunities a greater number of HUD - assisted residents will have an opportunity to build assets, which may lead to homeownership. New FSS awards will be announced in early 2024. </p></article>

HUD continues to break barriers as part of HUD's leadership of PAVE to address housing - related barriers to wealth generation. Specifically, the interagency initiative continues to combat bias in home appraisals. FHA is now contributing its appraisal data to FHFA's Federal Shared Appraisal Database, the nation's first publicly available datasets of aggregate statistics on appraisal records. FHA is also working to ensure that any borrower who suspects they have been a potential victim of appraisal bias be informed of their options, including the right to request a Reconsideration of a Value (ROV) on the appraisal. Through HUD's new partnership with the National Association of Real Estate Brokers (NAREB), the Agency will work to increase education and outreach, and take a bold step toward remedying appraisal discrimination, closing the wealth gap, and advancing racial equity.

<p>Seeking Public Comment on PAVE and Appraisal Valuation Efforts: Building off of HUD's January 2023 draft mortgagee letter discussing proposed processes for receipt and handling of borrower requests for review of appraisal results, HUD and FHFA have initiated a working group to increase coordination and develop more consistent standards for the ROV processes of HUD's Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac lenders. Collectively, FHA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac represent approximately two - thirds of new originations in the mortgage market. HUD has also sought feedback on a proposed policy for Reconsideration of Value (ROV) Requests Initiated by the Borrower specifically to better understand the impact on historically disadvantaged communities in recognition that clear ROV policies are an important tool in addressing appraisal bias. HUD, in partnership with the Federal Housing Finance Agency, USDA, and the U.S. Department of <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 180, 0.3)" title="Veterans">Veterans</span> Affairs, will contribute full appraisal reports covering all the data elements per the data that FHA is now contributing to FHFA's Federal Shared Appraisal Database.

In June 2023, HUD hosted listening sessions with survivor advocacy organizations and housing industry groups to collect feedback on HUD's implementation of VAWA. Further, since the spring of 2022, as required by the 2022 reauthorization of VAWA, HUD has led a study effort that will provide an assessment of trafficking survivors ' housing needs. As part of this work, HUD has engaged extensively with stakeholders in the trafficking, gender - based violence, housing, and direct services communities, including partners from the government, advocacy, policy, and research sectors. Additionally, HUD is centering the knowledge, insight, and involvement of labor and sex trafficking survivors by engaging with survivors in listening sessions, roundtables, and ongoing collaboration throughout the analysis and report writing stages of a study titled Housing Needs of Survivors of Human Trafficking that will be delivered to Congress. </p></article>

<p>Lack of access to NSF staff and solicitations for NSF procurement actions hinder the creation of an equitable and inclusive contracting environment for <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 210, 255, 0.3)" title="Minority Serving Institutions">MSIs</span> and small businesses. The complexity of the Federal contracting framework hinders existing and new entrants from accessing the Federal acquisition process. Entities must be familiar with Federal Acquisition and all supplemental agency guidance. Existing category management practices and best - in - class solutions can negatively impact the ability of disadvantaged entities and new entrants to position themselves for access to compete and secure awards. Data used to validate the application of category management principles demonstrates that small businesses under category management have received a proportionally lower share of spending than others. Large contracts can increase the efficiency of contract spending, eliminate redundant agreements, and reduce administrative burdens; however, this action could adversely impact contracts available for small and disadvantaged entities and equity goals for Federal acquisitions. </p></article>

<p>According to a participant survey following the pilot " " Level Up to Public Service " " event, 63 % of the students expressed interest in pursuing a career in the Federal government before the event, and this figure rose to 78 % after the event. This 15 percentage - point increase in interest indicates that this event enhanced awareness of and fostered interest in careers within the public service sector among college students from underrepresented communities. Students who are aware of Federal job opportunities face challenges with the application process. OPM's ODEIA has partnered with institutions of higher education, including <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 210, 255, 0.3)" title="Minority Serving Institutions">HBCUs</span> and other <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 210, 255, 0.3)" title="Minority Serving Institutions">MSIs</span>, and have collected reports from student participants that have indicated there are challenges accessing and support in submitting applications for Federal internships and early career positions. Specifically, the following challenges have been reported to various Federal Chief Diversity Officers government - wide: Students have limited exposure to or awareness of public service opportunities; Students are experiencing challenges finding appropriate internships that support individual career goals; Students need specific training to complete the Federal application process; Students prefer internship opportunities that support their career goals, while also meeting their financial obligations. OPM, the Department of Labor, and OMB recently developed and launched a new portal on USAJOBS for prospective Federal interns. President Biden also expressed a strong commitment to paid internships as an equity issue in White House Executive Order 14035 and the Guidance on Promoting Internship and Other Student and Early Career Programs in the Federal Government. Additional actions that expose students and recent graduates from diverse backgrounds to Federal career opportunities and provide them with the necessary resources and support to apply for those positions are needed to build a robust pipeline of early career talent. </p></article>

<p>Federal employees and retirees face increasing health care premiums (as a percentage of income) and difficulty affording paying their share of premiums, as well as health plan copayments and coinsurance. These increases disproportionately impact lower wage Federal employees and retirees as there is no adjustment to reflect differences in family incomes. The government contribution toward FEHB enrollee premium is set in statute. These contributions are the lesser of 72 percent of the weighted average premium of all plans or 75 percent of the premium of the plan chosen by the enrollee. The government contribution formula makes no distinction between the grade or salary level of the Federal employee or the amount of the annuitant's annuity payment. In other words, a <span style="background-color: rgba(240, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Senior">Senior</span> Executive enrolled in Blue Cross Basic pays the same self only premium as the GS - 5 enrolled in the same plan, even though the <span style="background-color: rgba(240, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Senior">Senior</span> Executive may earn three times the pay of the GS - 5. Similarly, health plan cost sharing at time of service, deductibles, and the maximum out of pocket payment allowed are not adjusted based on enrollee income or grade. The FEHB Program does not currently have information on the family income of individual employees or retirees to enable targeting of the FEHB benefit to those with lower incomes, and further research is needed to understand what factors affect non - enrollment and how employees perceive affordability. </p></article>

<p>Those who are in lowest graded positions are approximately four times as likely to decline FEHB coverage than those in the highest graded tier. According to the Federal Employee Benefits Survey (FEBS), OPM understands that the primary reason Federal employees decline FEHB coverage is because they have coverage through TRICARE or their spouse's employer - based insurance. However, FEBS results also show that those in the lowest wage categories are less likely to be covered by another person's health insurance or TRICARE than those in higher wage categories. Based on responses to the FEBS, OPM understands that employees at lower grade levels are more likely to report that they are not enrolled because " " health insurance through the FEHB is too expensive: " " Federal Wage System (hourly employees) - 15.3 % GS 1 - 6 - 5.6 % GS 7 - 12 - 4.8 % GS 13 - 15 - 2.2 % <span style="background-color: rgba(240, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Senior">Senior</span> Executive Service, <span style="background-color: rgba(240, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Senior">Senior</span> Leader (SL) - 0 % </p></article>

Using CX research practices, learn from our employees about their experiences with working with claimants as they apply to the <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Disabled">disability</span> programs. Develop, market, and assess effectiveness of informative materials, including priority language translations, to educate the public and other stakeholders on SSI eligibility and the application process. Complete our regulatory agenda 18 to simplify SSI, particularly our In - Kind Support and Maintenance (ISM) policies. Under current policy, ISM refers to reported or estimated assistance with food and / or shelter provided to SSI claimants from others within or outside their households. We determine claimants ' eligibility for and amount of SSI payments, partially based on the amount of ISM they receive. Simplifying ISM policies will make the SSI program easier for the public to understand and less burdensome for us to administer, and reduce the potential for improper payments. Omitting Food from ISM Calculation: Removes food from the calculation of ISM. Food assistance received from others will no longer impact claimants ' benefit eligibility and amount. (NPRM. Feb. 15, 2023. 88 FR 9779.) Expansion of the Rental Subsidy Policy for SSI Applicants and Recipients: Expands rental subsidy exemption currently applicable in seven States nationwide, exempting claimants from ISM from other household members if they pay at least one third of the SSI benefit on rent. (NPRM. Aug. 24, 2023. 88 FR 57910.) Expand the Definition of a Public Assistance (PA) Household: Adds Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to the list of means - tested programs included in our definition of PA households; if every household member receives at least one of the specified types of assistance, we would not reduce SSI benefits due to ISM or deeming from other household members. (NPRM. Sept. 29, 2023. 88 FR 67148.) </p></article>

The non - English instructions will help applicants with LEP complete the English - language form SS - 5. 6) In September 2023, we added race and ethnicity questions to the internet SSN replacement application process (iSSNRC) used to obtain a replacement SSN card through the my Social Security (mySSA) portal. </p></article>

<p>In initial claim situations, underpayments stem from benefits that are due back to the date of onset2 ², the first day a claimant meets the definition of <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Disabled">disability</span> or statutory blindness. Once an initial claim is approved, the person receiving SSI is paid back to the date of their application or the date of onset if they meet the definition of <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Disabled">disability</span> or statutory blindness after they submit their application. These past - due benefits are considered underpayments and may be subject to installments. In post - entitlement situations, underpayments are generally the result of reporting delays. For example, people receiving SSI payments are required to timely report any changes in their medical or non - medical (i.e., income, resources, or living arrangements) circumstances that may impact their payments. When a person receiving SSI payments does not timely report changes that will affect their payment amount, the field office will update the record noting a discrepancy, which may cause an underpayment. If an underpayment exceeds three times the Federal Benefit Rate, the payment due to the recipient is subject to installments. 23 </p></article>

<p>1) In FY 2023, to restore SSI applications closer to pre - pandemic levels, we launched a new SSI " " Basic Needs " " campaign in support of our FYs 2022 - 2023 Agency Priority Goal (APG) to increase SSI applications nationwide by 15 percent and increase applications from underserved communities by 25 percent, 1,758,656 and 127,749 applications, respectively. We have seen an increase in the overall number of SSI applications, nationally and in underserved communities. Since the campaign launched: a. Our digital marketing tactics generated 1.81 million referrals from our SSI website to the online SSI Protective Filing tool, yielding 345,000 SSI applications through September 3, 2023. The tool allows individuals and third - party helpers to establish a protective filing 10 online and request an appointment to file for benefits. b. Our marketing generated more than 1.9 billion impressions across all tactics and over 2.7 million website visits. C. Through September 29, 2023, we exceeded our APG target for SSI applications in underserved communities relative to the 2021 baseline by receiving nearly 135,000 applications. We were about one percent short of the nationwide SSI application target of increasing applications by 15 percent relative to the 2021 baseline, receiving about 1.74 million applications. d. We added a paper survey to 300,000 of the 2.1 million mailers and added an online survey for those who visited our English and Spanish vanity URL, or custom shortened link. We received 2,575 responses with as many as 81 percent of the respondents saying the information was either " " very helpful " " or " " helpful " ", among other key findings. 2) In FY 2023, we hosted several Outreach to Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Kids Subgroup Meetings and listening sessions with advocates to gain a better understanding of external experiences related to SSI for children, and to hear fresh ideas on how to reach parents and caregivers. 3) In FY 2023, we mailed a notice to more than 323,000 SSI recipients between the ages of 14 and 17 (transition - aged youth) and their adult representatives, to provide more information about the changes that happen with SSI payments when youth turn age 18. 11 SSI " " Basic Needs " " Campaign Marketing Tactics The campaign's digital tactics included Search Engine Marketing, social media, online display ads, YouTube video ads, and an updated SSI webpage. Non - digital tactics included TV and radio public service announcements, radio ads, direct mail to 2.1 million households in underserved communities, convenience store posters, and drugstore bag inserts. 4) On October 4, 2022, we established the Office of <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 120, 255, 0.3)" title="Native American">Native American</span> Partnerships, and published an accompanying press release. The office's mission is to elevate and centralize efforts to administer comprehensive programs and policies related to American Indians and Alaska Natives. The office also works to enhance our relationship with <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 120, 255, 0.3)" title="Native American">Tribes</span> and serves as the primary point of contact on <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 120, 255, 0.3)" title="Native American">Tribal</span> affairs. 5) In February 2023, we streamlined the Continuing <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Disabled">Disability</span> Review Report to make it easier to complete, by: a.

<p>6) In May 2023, we established the Office of Transformation (OT), which includes our Customer Experience (CX) team. The OT's mission is to facilitate the most critical business enhancements that serve the public and support our frontline employees. The mission is underpinned by CX to ensure equitable access to SSA's programs. The OT is undertaking the SSI simplification equity strategy and plans to include accessibility expertise to ensure greater <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Disabled">disability</span> equity in our initiatives. 7) On August 21, 2023, we removed the signature requirement for all versions of form SSA - 455, Continuing <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Disabled">Disability</span> Review, making it less burdensome for the public to complete and submit. 8) In September 2023, we implemented the new Upload Documents portal. This portal allows respondents to submit evidence and some SSA forms electronically through an Internet portal. In addition, we also are allowing eSignature of some forms through the Upload Documents portal. This new portal reduces the need for respondents to call or travel to a field office to submit forms or evidence. </p></article>

We also formed a technical working group (TWG) consisting of people with <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Disabled">disabilities</span> who helped design the study, monitored the progress, and reviewed and provided comments on products. We compensated TWG participants while protecting participant eligibility in benefit programs, the first time a Federal agency has done this. Paying lived experience experts, per activity, fostered meaningful relationships with communities served by the Government, and offered unique opportunities for innovative improvements in policy and programming based on data rooted in and guided by lived experience. 2) In the Fall of 2023, we published a Regulatory Agenda ¹ 2 that prioritizes equity, including: a.

Effective November 30, 2022, we increased from $ 6,000 to $ 7,200 the maximum fee amount a representative may receive using the fee agreement process (one of two mutually exclusive fee authorization processes). This was the first increase in 13 years, with the intent to incentivize representatives to take on more SSI claimants as clients. 2) In FY 2023, we exceeded our FY 2023 goals for targeted review of sample cases with denial determinations to ensure effective and uniform administration of the <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Disabled">disability</span> program by completing 25,157 cases. 3) In FY 2023, we continued to reach out to unrepresented claimants to prepare them for the hearing process and explain their right to representation. </p></article>

<p>The implementation of equity and inclusion into foreign assistance programs, policy, and practice is being led by the Office of Foreign Assistance, in coordination with the Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, and key bureaus and offices across the Department. Chief to this effort is global tracking of Department and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) foreign assistance programs addressing the specific needs of marginalized racial, ethnic, and other underserved communities. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2022, planned foreign assistance investments totaled $ 56.8 million, spread across all geographic regions. This complements existing tracking of programs and planned investments for other marginalized populations, such as <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 120, 255, 0.3)" title="Native American">Indigenous</span> groups, <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 210, 0.3)" title="LGBTQ+">LGBTQI</span> + communities, <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 90, 0.3)" title="Women">women</span> and girls, persons with <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Disabled">disabilities</span>, children in adversity, young and emerging leaders, and religious minorities. Additionally, the Department is creating a Social Inclusion Analysis Tool outlined in the 2022 Plan to help Department officials integrate and operationalize equity and inclusion into externally - facing foreign affairs areas: foreign policy implementation, foreign assistance program design, and diplomatic statecraft. Focus group beta - testing in 2022 was essential to the tool's drafting, which is still in progress and will be custom - tailored for Department needs. </p></article>

<p>Under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, Treasury supported the economic recovery for communities and individuals impacted by COVID - 19 through the ARP. For example, the Department and the CDFI Fund have deployed historic amounts of capital to CDFIs and MDIs - institutions that have a demonstrated track record of reaching financially underserved borrowers. In addition, through the ECIP, Treasury has made close to $ 8.4 billion in investments in 170 community financial institutions, in addition to over $ 1.73 billion in grants through the CDFI ERP, and a historic $ 226 million investment in 68 Puerto Rican cooperativas, or cooperative community financial institutions. New ECIP reporting data made available in October 2023, reflecting lending in the final six months of 2022, showed that ECIP lenders originated a total of approximately $ 26 billion in loans, of which approximately 75 % went to low - and moderate - income borrowers, borrowers in <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Rural">rural</span> communities and other categories of qualified lending. Approximately one third of their total originations, $ 8.6 billion, were " " deep impact " " loans, made to the hardest - to - serve borrowers, including those that are low - income, residents on <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 120, 255, 0.3)" title="Native American">Tribal</span> lands and in US Territories and owners of very small businesses. Treasury leveraged the ERA program to create the first - ever nationwide infrastructure to prevent eviction, with more than 12.3 million household payments to families at risk of eviction as of June 30, 2023. This program has been particularly effective at reaching low - income and / or traditionally underserved renters, including <span style="background-color: rgba(240, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Black">Black</span> and <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 90, 0.3)" title="Women">women</span> - headed households. By reimagining how the IRS serves families, the IRS delivered half of the expanded Child Tax Credit (CTC) via monthly payments from July to December 2021. Treasury also collaborated with Code for America, a non - governmental non - profit, to build a streamlined, mobile - friendly portal in English and Spanish to make it easier for families to access the expanded CTC. New Census data released in 2022 showed that the expanded CTC was the leading driver behind a 46 percent decline in child poverty in 2021 - cutting the annual child poverty rate to its lowest - ever recorded level including record lows in <span style="background-color: rgba(240, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Black">Black</span>, <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 120, 0.3)" title="Latinx">Hispanic</span>, <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 120, 255, 0.3)" title="Native American">Native American</span>, <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="AAPI">Asian</span>, and white child poverty. Additionally, the permanent lifting of restrictions that prevented some Puerto Rican families from receiving the CTC led to 200,000 more Puerto Rican families receiving the credit when they filed taxes in 2022 compared to the year prior. As of September 2023, Treasury has approved 54 out of 56 state and territory applications for SSBCI Capital Programs totaling over $ 8.2 billion in allocations, and has announced approvals of up to $ 73 million corresponding to applications representing 39 <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 120, 255, 0.3)" title="Native American">Tribes</span>.

<p>Office of Tax Analysis study on Disparities in the Benefits of Tax Expenditures by Race and Ethnicity. While the IRS doesn't have access to race data, racial disparities in audit rates mean that <span style="background-color: rgba(240, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Black">Black</span> taxpayers are audited at three to five times the rate of non - <span style="background-color: rgba(240, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Black">Black</span> taxpayers. As described in a memo from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue Daniel Werfel to Senator Ronald Wyden, this disparate impact is believed to be driven by correspondence audits among taxpayers who claim the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Filing of tax returns accounts for 63 % of the annual federal paperwork burden, including costs for preparing tax returns, as well as filing through software or third - party preparers. Americans often miss out on tax credits for which they are eligible, such as the estimated 5 million individuals who miss out on the EITC, which is roughly 80 percent of those eligible. </p></article>

<p>2022 Equity Action Plan Update (pursuant to EO 13985): Since the first Equity Action Plan launched in April 2022, Treasury has made significant progress toward fostering an equitable recovery from the pandemic; ensuring the flow of mission - driven capital to those who need it most; improving the tax system to make it easier for all Americans to receive the benefits for which they are eligible; reforming debt collection practices to reduce burdens on underserved communities; and expanding opportunity for small businesses through procurement and contracting. For instance, Treasury's Office of Procurement created an Equity Heat Map to identify upcoming opportunities more easily for small, socioeconomically disadvantaged, or underserved businesses to compete for contracts. Treasury researchers developed a method for imputing race and ethnicity data in tax data, which has enabled multiple ongoing and completed studies, including one on audit disparities between <span style="background-color: rgba(240, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Black">Black</span> and non - <span style="background-color: rgba(240, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Black">Black</span> taxpayers and one on the distribution of tax expenditures by race and ethnicity. In addition, a collaborative effort among Treasury, the IRS, and the Census Bureau allowed for evaluation of the demographics of the recipients of the first round of Economic Impact Payments in 2020. </p></article>

<p>Develop new technical guidance on how to advance racial and ethnic equity among underserved communities in the policy and the program cycle. Scale up implementation of Inclusive Development Assessments (IDAs). An IDA is an assessment tool that guides in - country interviews and research to help identify in a particular country those populations that are marginalized and excluded from access to public services such as health, education, transportation, and or economic opportunities. Through the IDA we are able to analyze the country's social, economic, political, and cultural factors that lead to marginalization, determine access to assets, resources, opportunities, and services. IDA concludes with a summary of the context and provides specific recommendations for USAID to increase inclusion of marginalized groups in their development programmes and policies. Analyze up to 10 Performance Plan and Report (PPR) Key Issue Narratives and identify new opportunities for advancing racial and ethnic equity and support for underserved communities in programming.

<p>a) 2022 Equity Action Plan Update (pursuant to EO 13985) Since the launch of WorkwithUSAID.gov in November 2021, USAID has approved more than 4,700 partner profiles in the platform's Partner Directory, and of those partners, more than 1,600 have completed the pre - engagement assessment. By registering in the Partner Directory and taking the Pre - Engagement Assessment, potential partners are able to increase the visibility of their work, connect with others in the development community, and assess whether or not they are ready to respond to a USAID solicitation. The team has translated the top 20 resources on the platform into French, Spanish, and Arabic for use in host countries where USAID works. These resources are helping to bridge the gap for local entities that are not fluent in English as USAID continues to develop additional documentation in foreign languages. USAID's Inclusive Development e - learning module is now mandatory for all of the workforce. As of June 2023, 86 percent (11,200 out of approximately 13,000) of USAID's workforce have received the training on Inclusive Development. USAID held three external and three internal consultations with stakeholders, delivered two informational webinars for USAID staff, held consultations with program participants across USAID Missions and briefed all Bureaus and Independent Offices (B / IOs) on the development of the ' Know Your Protections ' (KYP) document (formerly known as the ' Beneficiaries Bill of Rights ' - BBoR). This document aims to summarize and highlight existing protections for USAID program participants, making them accessible and easily understandable. The document has been revised and is currently undergoing clearance at the agency. USAID developed the Social, Economic, and Environmental Accountability Mechanism (SEE - AM), which advances program participant protections. The mechanism provides a channel for program participants and affected communities to inform the Agency of harm experienced in relation to USAID's programs and projects overseas. USAID secured program funds for and onboarded a full - time Accountability Mechanism Official to manage SEE - AM design and implementation, and coordination of complaints processing. USAID launched the updated Acquisition and Assistance (A & A) Strategy and Implementation Plan in FY 2023, incorporating DEIA principles, such as: USAID simplified and reduced its onerous pre - award risk survey for local organizations seeking USAID funding. Agency lowered the barrier to entry by promoting more opportunities where applicants submit an initial concept paper (about five pages) before they are invited to submit a full application (typically 30 pages or more). This makes the initial step less costly for applicants. Issued a Renewal Award Guide and Template to train A & A staff to use a mechanism that leverages practices from collaborating, learning and adapting, and responds to adjustments in dynamic operating environments. The <span style="background-color: rgba(240, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Senior">Senior</span> Procurement Executive (SPE) sent a notice to remind prime contractors about the requirement of reporting data against their small business subcontracting plan and to improve the accuracy of data they submit. </p></article>

<p>The Agency identified and created a cadre of training, tools, and resources to streamline proposal and evaluation processes. M Bureau provides staff a platform to share innovative practices and systems to streamline procurement processes through the A & A Innovation Community of Practice. USAID updated its Youth Policy and released the new Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment Policy in March 2023. USAID released its new <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 210, 0.3)" title="LGBTQ+">LGBTQI</span> + Inclusive Development Policy in August 2023 and Strategic Religious Engagement Policy in September 2023. These policies reiterate the importance of and clarify approaches to inclusion and equity in USAID's programs, for USAID staff and stakeholders. USAID recently announced the launch of the Racial and Ethnic Equity Initiative, and teams are conducting assessments and collecting data from USAID Missions overseas to build a knowledge base of operational practices and best practices that have successfully advanced social inclusion and racial equity in foreign assistance programming. Exposure to these best practices and technical guidance will encourage the adoption of quality equity programs on a broader scale. USAID Missions and Bureaus are now required to report on a new key issue narrative in their annual reports capturing racial and ethnic equity. They also must annually report on the percentage of completed evaluations with at least one local expert on the evaluation team. USAID released the Agency's highest level policy document, the Policy Framework, in March 2023. The Policy Framework emphasizes a commitment to embed DEIA principles across our programs, people, processes, policies, and practices so that development gains are more locally - led and benefit people of all backgrounds and identities. b) Environmental Justice Scorecard (pursuant to section 223 of EO 14008) USAID is not required to complete the Environmental Justice Scorecard. USAID promotes environmental equity and monitors progress through the Global Action for Climate Equity. c) Additional Efforts to Advance Equity Fourteen country - level Inclusive Development Assessments (IDAs), which aim to map the context and needs of marginalized groups through an intersectional lens to improve equity in programming, have been performed across the Agency. The ID Hub's Inclusive Development Activity for Mission Support (IDAMS) has begun work on three additional IDAs and is poised to to scale up these activities in FY 2024. The Office of Civil Rights established the External Civil Rights Division covering Title VI and other relevant civil rights authorities to ensure USAID complies with Title VI requirements under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Division receives and addresses complaints of discrimination in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance The External Civil Rights Division's internal website launched in June 2023, which educates USAID staff on the Title VI legal requirements and statutes and how they apply to USAID programs and partners. In addition to the significant progress made in awarding more funds directly to local entities - which, in FY2022 reached the highest level ($ 1.6 billion) and percent (10.2 percent) in over a decade - USAID has developed a new method to track the extent to which the Agency's programming is locally led.

<p>Over the past several years, USAID has championed equity across policy, programming, and learning through an inclusive development approach that incorporates considerations relevant to gender equality, social inclusion (e.g. inclusion of underserved populations such as <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 210, 0.3)" title="LGBTQ+">LGBTQI</span> +, persons with <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Disabled">disabilities</span>, <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 120, 255, 0.3)" title="Native American">Indigenous</span> Peoples), and strategic religious engagement throughout policy and the program cycle. Despite these robust efforts, USAID must update policy, guidance, training, and the way evidence is collected to ensure USAID staff possess the tools and skills needed to effectively address inequities faced by historically marginalized racial and ethnic communities impacted by USAID programming. Intersecting identities of underserved groups (i.e. <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 210, 0.3)" title="LGBTQ+">LGBTQI</span> + person of color, or, individual with <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="Disabled">disabilities</span> who also belongs to a religious minority) makes the importance of understanding these dynamics and social structures all the more crucial. </p></article>

<p>One particular barrier is that local knowledge is not sufficiently included in the evidence base that informs USAID strategic planning and programming. This could mean that our programs are not designed to be flexible enough to fully meet the specific needs of marginalized groups and communities, which could limit their participation and our impact. USAID must therefore expand its capacity to better use local and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 120, 255, 0.3)" title="Native American">Indigenous</span> knowledge, particularly from historically marginalized racial and ethnic communities, in informing and evaluating programming.

And while in recent years the Agency has implemented an inclusive development approach to guide programming toward more inclusive and equitable outcomes, there remains a lack of comprehensive guidance on programming to support racial and ethnic equity specifically, which may be necessary given the complex systems that have been built over centuries to marginalize racial and ethnic communities. </p></article>

<p>Several barriers stand in the way of advancing on these ambitious priorities. For instance, as an Agency we often lack certain expertise and dedicated resources needed to develop programs that fully incorporate gender equality and inclusive development policies and guidance. Additionally, we are still building our capacity to apply certain local and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 120, 255, 0.3)" title="Native American">Indigenous</span> knowledge to a range of USAID programming, particularly from historically marginalized racial and ethnic communities. The limited resources and capacity is linked to not having dedicated advisors with the full inclusive development portfolio, which includes having technical knowledge and expertise related to the challenges and barriers faced by numerous marginalized groups locally. </p></article>

<p>D. USDA will create new, more, and better market opportunities for producers, which creates a fairer playing field for small - and mid - size farmers. USDA is investing in developing new market opportunities and fairer markets SO that producers have more power in the marketplace and greater opportunities to generate income and make a living in agriculture. Ongoing efforts involve investments in new market opportunities, amelioration of supply chain bottlenecks, and improvements in fair competition. E. USDA will expand reach to all producers by leveraging partnerships with trusted technical advisors. Across the Department - FSA, NRCS, RMA, NIFA, and the Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement (OPPE) - USDA will continue and expand grant and cooperative agreement programs that support delivery of conservation assistance, risk management education, farming and production - related education, and technical assistance to underserved farmers (including beginning, limited resource, socially disadvantaged, and <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 180, 0.3)" title="Veterans">veteran</span> farmers). F. USDA will target direct assistance and technical support based on degree of need. USDA is implementing support for support for underserved producers; progressive payment factoring; and whole - farm revenue approaches particularly suited to smaller operations. Where USDA has discretion, as in the ad - hoc disaster programs, the Department has been pursuing these strategies administratively. Other permanent programs would need legislative action; USDA is providing technical assistance to Congress on these areas. G. USDA will institutionalize access for broader stakeholder viewpoints. USDA is making a concerted effort to bring new voices to the table and to expand its stakeholder base. To that end, a large group of both longstanding and new formal committees are providing valuable input, including: the USDA Equity Commission; NRCS state technical committees; FSA County Committees, including urban county committees; and other new and continuing Federal Advisory Committees (Urban Agriculture, <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 120, 255, 0.3)" title="Native American">Tribal</span>, Minority Farmers, New and Beginning Farmers). </p></article>

<p>USDA is committed to continually improving services to communities marginalized, underserved, and overburdened by pollution, with a particular emphasis on the dozens of departmental programs covered by the Administration's Justice40 Initiative, pursuant to Executive Order 14008 - programs whose investments relate to climate change, clean energy and energy efficiency, clean transit, affordable and sustainable housing, training and workforce development, remediation and reduction of legacy pollution, and the development of critical clean water and wastewater infrastructure. Across USDA, over 12,000 grants, agreements, and contracts associated with Justice40 Initiative covered programs were distributed in FY 2022, promoting nearly $ 7 billion in economic development. The programs have a broad and varied reach. In FY 2022, for example, the Forest Service's Job Corps program provided more than 1,500 young adults from underserved backgrounds with over 273,000 hours of training focused on firefighting, conservation, and <span style="background-color: rgba(150, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Rural">rural</span> development, furthering employment opportunities.

In turn, communities lose their trust in and willingness to engage with the federal government. Still other barriers relate to inadequate infrastructure, such as broadband access, which prevents businesses and individuals from fully competing and participating in the digital age. </p></article>

This 2023 update builds on that strong foundation and follows the lead of President Biden's Executive Order 14091, which regularizes equity action planning and insists that federal agencies use all the policy levers we have to make progress. President Biden has emphasized that equity is a generational commitment, not a one - year project. I emphatically agree. Success depends on the institutionalization this year's plan reflects. At USDA, we have embedded equity in the work we do across the Department, and we are moving forward together, based on the insight that our country is stronger when everyone has a seat at the table and everyone has food on their plate. It is our moral imperative to do the challenging but achievable work of building a more inclusive future. Under this Administration, equity is more than a catchphrase. It's a promise. </p></article>

<p>Increasing access to NAP. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) has long heard about the challenges underserved farmers have faced in navigating the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP). In January 2023, FSA announced program updates to reduce the paperwork burden on these producers to access free basic NAP coverage with a NAP service - fee waiver. Specifically, the requirement for a separate application for coverage prior to the loss event was eliminated for anyone already certified as an underserved producer - that is, for beginning, <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 180, 0.3)" title="Veterans">veteran</span>, limited resource, <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 90, 0.3)" title="Women">women</span>, or minority farmers.

<p>VA operates a large and complex acquisition program. This inherently favors firms who already understand the program or have the resources necessary to learn it. The perceived difficulty of learning the system may act as a barrier to new entrants and disadvantaged businesses with limited resources. Overcoming this information gap will be essential to the success of underserved firms. Reducing costs and administrative burdens are in tension with the need for additional contracts. Also, VA's mission and statutory mandate require VA to be <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 180, 0.3)" title="Veterans">Veterans</span> First in all efforts surrounding procurement. The <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 180, 0.3)" title="Veterans">Veterans</span> First statutory mandate is implemented through the VA Rule of Two.

<p>OMB illustrates that VA contracting is increasingly dominated by established vendors rather than new entrants. As VA has reduced its total vendor base from 11,964 in FY 2020 to 10,887 in FY 2022, the share of established vendors (not recent or new entrants) has increased. In FY 2020, 61.7 % of VA's vendors were established vendors. In FY 2022, the share of established vendors increased to 66.6 %. This suggests the reduction in total vendors is occurring at the expense of new or recent entrants. An analysis of VA - funded contract actions from the Federal Procurement Data System demonstrates how the <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 180, 0.3)" title="Veterans">Veterans</span> First procurement hierarchy reduces the number of contract opportunities for non - <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 180, 0.3)" title="Veterans">Veteran</span> disadvantaged firms. In FY 2022, out of $ 6.3 billion in contract dollars awarded through some type of set - aside, VA awarded $ 5.7 billion (91 %) specifically using the SDVOSB set - aside. Since the SDVOSB set - aside is first on VA's procurement hierarchy, this result is predictable. However, the second tier on VA's procurement hierarchy (VOSB set - aside) was used to award only $ 59 million, a dramatically lower figure. Awards through the HUBZone and 8 (a) Business Development Program set asides were even lower. Alternatively, the last tier on VA's set - aside hierarchy received the second highest volume of dollars; $ 461 million were awarded through the general small business set - aside. These data illustrate two factors. First, the procurement hierarchy tends to screen out contracting opportunities for programs lower on the hierarchy. Second, the intermediate tiers such as HUBZone, </p></article>

In FY 2023, VA's energy performance contracting program began considering environmental justice as an evaluation criterion for new project starts. Established VA's National Environmental Protection Act Interim Guidance for Project parameters to consider environmental justice (EJ) as part of the process. In 2022, VA published an updated Directive 0065, Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience Planning, that incorporated pursuing climate mitigation efforts that advance environmental justice as a core policy. This policy update was not directly related to the VA's EJ Strategic Plan, but rather part of larger planning in which environmental justice was prioritized. In response to Executive Order 14057 VA established a <span style="background-color: rgba(240, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="Senior">senior</span> level Sustainability Task Force with environmental justice as a cross - cutting priority among all climate and environmental areas. </p></article>
