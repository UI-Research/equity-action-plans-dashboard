<p>In March 2023, DHS published the Privacy Impact Assessment for ICE alternatives to detention programs, including an Appendix that addresses the Case Management Pilot Program (CMPP). CMPP leads to more equitable outcomes for program participants, many of whom are racial minorities, by providing services that include, but are not limited to, mental health services, trafficking screening, legal orientation programs, cultural orientation programs, connections to social services, and departure planning and reintegration services for individuals returning to their home countries. The Privacy Impact Assessment describes the application of privacy mitigation measures to the CMPP, including the limits of data sharing between CRCL and ICE regarding program participants. CMPP enrollments in Houston began in April 2023 and enrollments in New York began in May 2023. As of November 2023, there are 248 enrolled participants. Enrollments will continue throughout the year. CMPP plans to add more service providers later in calendar year 2023 via FY 2022 appropriated funds of $ 15 million that were awarded as a grant to the CMPP National Board in July 2023. The National Board began the solicitation <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">process</span> in July 2023 to award those funds to service providers. </p></article>

<p>One of the cornerstones of DHS's approach to equity is a strong commitment to stakeholder and community engagement - to understand concerns about barriers faced by members of underserved communities in DHS's programs and to assess the effectiveness of DHS's efforts to address those barriers. Over the past year, DHS hosted engagements specific to the areas of focus in this plan. For example, in August 2022, the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) led a listening session to hear directly from Arab, Middle Eastern, Muslim, and South Asian (AMEMSA) faith - based and community leaders regarding civil rights and civil liberties concerns. The discussion focused on DHS policies and practices, particularly with respect to screening and redress. In February 2023, the Office of Partnership and Engagement (OPE) held a listening session with diverse faith leaders in Dearborn, Michigan to better understand the threat landscape and share DHS information and <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">resources</span>.

<p>The DHS Customer Experience Directorate (CXD) took on several initiatives aimed at simplifying the experience of noncitizens navigating the immigration system, with the goal of improving case management and compliance. The team partnered with ICE to deliver designs for a website, tentatively called the " " ICE Portal, " " providing consolidated information to noncitizens regarding required check - ins, court dates, and other important information. User research will be conducted internally and in partnership with nongovernmental organizations (NGO) to ensure that the website is usable and meets the needs of the intended audience, including individuals who are LEP and individuals with disabilities. Partnering with community organizations to gather user feedback on the design, language, and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">accessibility</span> helps to understand the needs of noncitizens.

<p>When President Biden, on his first day in office, issued Executive Order (EO) 13985, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities through the Federal Government, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) answered the call to embed equity at the center of <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">policy</span>, operations, and decision - making throughout the Department. At its core, equity calls for the government to treat all individuals in a fair, just, and impartial manner - with the recognition that many communities have often been denied such treatment in the past, resulting in disparities today. To underscore the priority I place on this work and secure commitments to advance equity in the Department's programs and activities, in March 2021 I convened the DHS Equity Task Force, headed by the Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, including members from all the Department's operational agencies and Headquarters offices. </p></article>

<p>(1) Reduce barriers to citizenship and naturalization through continued evaluation of programs, policies, and outreach opportunities. There is a significant gap between the annual naturalization rate and the annual size of the population eligible to naturalize. Commonly cited barriers to naturalization include: a lack of understanding about the naturalization <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">process</span>; a real or perceived inability to meet the English language requirement that is part of the naturalization <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">process</span>; a lack of ability to pay application fees; and a lack of understanding about reduced fees and fee waiver options. To address these barriers, USCIS will strengthen efforts to promote naturalization through citizenship education and outreach, capacity building efforts, and more streamlined naturalization application services. (2) Promote equitable use of AI technology across the Department through the development and application of new guidance as well as intra - agency coordination. With increased use of AI in carrying out DHS's homeland security mission, members of underserved communities may face disproportionate or disparate impacts, such as additional scrutiny or denial of benefits based on the potential for algorithms to operate in a manner that exhibits inappropriate biases in violation of <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">law</span> and DHS <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">policy</span>. To address these barriers, DHS will implement Department - wide <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">policy</span> guidance regarding the equitable use and implementation of AI technology and leverage the ongoing work of the Artificial Intelligence Task Force (AITF) and other internal working groups to establish a framework for trustworthy and responsible AI. (3) Counter domestic violent extremism (DVE) and targeted violence through a public health - informed approach. As the Department continues to tackle DVE threats, members of certain underserved communities (e.g., AMEMSA, Jewish, LGBTQI + and Black communities) continue to have concerns about DVE threats that impact their communities. To address these barriers, DHS will build the capacity of prevention professionals, SO that they can better understand and use data - driven information on how underserved communities are often the targets and victims of domestic terrorists; </p></article>

<p>During a June 2023 stakeholder listening session on AI and Equity at DHS, stakeholders raised concerns about transparency and disparate impact in DHS's use of AI. Stakeholders also recommended enhancing community engagement on the use and application of AI going forward to build greater trust with communities. Staff consultation with the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">policy</span> development engagement dating back to the 2014 - 15 White House Big Data Papers, literature study, and interagency engagement with colleagues who have faced similar challenges and developed ethical codes and best practices in response, provide a basis for anticipating the challenges to ensuring compliance with applicable <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">law</span> and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">policy</span> and in using AI to advance equity across all DHS missions. To encourage accountability and responsible use of AI in government programs and processes, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) developed an AI accountability framework ensuring AI is responsible, equitable, traceable, reliable, and governable. According to NIST, how accurately face recognition software tools identify people of varied sex, age, and racial backgrounds depends in part on the algorithm and data used. Results captured in the NIST report, Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT) Part 3: Demographic Effects (NISTIR 8280), found empirical evidence for the existence of demographic differentials across algorithms and developers, with the most accurate algorithms producing many fewer errors; NIST expects those algorithms to have smaller demographic differentials. A key goal of the Department's use of facial recognition technology is identifying and eliminating, to the extent it exists, any improper bias. The Final Report of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (2021) determined that " " unintended bias can be introduced during many stages of the machine learning (ML) <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">process</span>, which can lead to disparate impacts in American society, a problem that has been documented in <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">law</span> enforcement contexts.

<p>Benefit applicants, both overseas and domestic, sometimes have difficulty attending USCIS appointments when the distance needed to travel is long. There are barriers related to transportation, health and safety, and finances. In FY 2023, USCIS's Refugee, Asylum, and International Operations (RAIO) began increasing the use of video technology to conduct I - 589 asylum interviews domestically, and I - 590 refugee interviews internationally, SO that applicants living in remote locations will not have to wait SO long or travel SO far. USCIS is currently drafting a proposed <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">rule</span> that would codify RAIO's flexibility to conduct remote interviews with refugee applicants abroad. In March 2023, USCIS published an extension to the Asylum Interpreter Temporary Final <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">Rule</span> (TFR) that allowed USCIS to provide telephonic interpreters for asylum applicants who speak one of 47 listed languages through September 12, 2023. Telephonic interpreters can also be connected to video interviews SO that remote interviews can be completed. The TFR temporarily reduced barriers for asylum applicants to attend and complete their interviews. There is a significant backlog of pending petitions for U nonimmigrant status due, in part, to the annual statutory cap limiting approvals to 10,000 principal petitions per fiscal year. As this backlog of over 250,000 filings are solely filed via paper and postal mail, USCIS is considering ways to leverage technology to improve processing to provide Employment Authorization Documents and deferred action for U petitioners and their derivatives with pending filings. As noted in the U.S. National Plan to End Gender - Based Violence, immigrant survivors face increased barriers to economic stability. They often encounter delayed processing times when applying for special immigration remedies for GBV victims that were established through VAWA and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, such as the VAWA self - petition, the U nonimmigrant status for eligible victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and qualifying eligible crimes, and the T nonimmigrant status for eligible victims of a severe form of trafficking in persons. Delays in <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> to work authorization and public benefits for which an individual is potentially eligible, such as housing assistance or health care, can increase vulnerabilities to abuse and undermine recovery and healing. For refugees living in many parts of the world to <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> the US Refugee Admissions Program, they need to be interviewed and processed by USCIS while they are overseas, which presents many logistical and travel challenges for both the refugees and USCIS staff. When USCIS has no permanent presence in a geographic area, processing occurs when USCIS has the staff to make several international trips to complete different processing steps, thereby increasing the processing time. There are numerous steps involved in processing benefits for refugee populations, such as medical exams, refugee interviews, finalization of the decision, and assurances for placement with domestic resettlement agencies. These steps typically take place sequentially and may take a long time in between steps. Noncitizen workers are particularly vulnerable to workplace abuses including unpaid wages, discrimination, health and safety violations, and reprisals for seeking to improve working conditions. In addition, noncitizen workers are often afraid to report violations to labor enforcement agencies or participate in labor standards investigations for fear of immigration - related retaliation or threats of deportation by their employers. </p></article>

Deferred action protects noncitizen workers from threats of immigration - related retaliation from exploitative employers. These improvements advance the Biden - Harris Administration's commitment to empowering workers and improving workplace conditions by enabling all workers, including noncitizens, to assert their legal rights. 3. Bidding on a DHS Contract. DHS strengthened efforts to engage small businesses, including those owned by members of underserved communities such as women, minorities, and individuals with disabilities, through various outreach activities. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2022, DHS exceeded all small business prime and socioeconomic goals as negotiated with the Small Business Administration, equating to $ 9 billion awarded to small businesses, including $ 4 billion to small, disadvantaged businesses. DHS is the largest spending agency to have this level of goal achievement. In FY 2022, the DHS Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) launched Small - to - Small Business Vendor Outreach Matchmaking Events (VOMEs), facilitating business - to - business meetings to encourage new entrants, explore subcontracting and teaming opportunities, and assist with decreasing gaps in small business capabilities. The VOME is another federal best practice and a first for federal OSDBU offices. Three VOMEs were held in FY 2022, garnering 1,100 registrants and nearly 800 meetings. Three VOMEs were also held in FY 2023, resulting in over 1,500 small business registrations and over 500 meetings. In FY 2023, OSDBU has hosted 10 Vendor Outreach Sessions to include four specifically reserved for underserved groups (e.g., service - disabled veteran - owned, women - owned, and HUBZone firms). 4.

These benefits offer critical protection for many of our most vulnerable noncitizens - those who have been victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons and other specified crimes, and those who are victims of battery or extreme cruelty by an abusive spouse or other family member.

<p>The DHS Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships (CP3) conducted targeted outreach to additional local and underserved communities, providing technical assistance and support to those stakeholders. The Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention (TVTP) Grant Program provides <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">funding</span> for state, local, Tribal, and territorial governments, nonprofits, and institutions of higher education to establish or enhance capabilities to prevent targeted violence and terrorism. In FY 2022, CP3 reached 49 new organizations and over 900 people, resulting in 31 applications from, and 11 awards to, organizations representing underserved communities. In response to a wave of bomb threats targeting Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in 2022, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Office for Bombing Prevention (OBP) conducted 27 courses for HBCU students and faculty in prevention and building resilience, trained more than 1,200 participants, delivered over 1,500 products, and saw a 54 percent increase in the more than 24,000 training video completions. Additional courses are ongoing. In 2022, CRCL, the DHS Office of State and Local <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">Law</span> Enforcement (OSLLE), and the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity through HBCUs, sponsored full - day courses at five HBCUs to help equip campus leaders and other community stakeholders with the problem - solving skills to prevent, protect, and mitigate the effects of, respond to, and recover from active shooter situations. Since July 2022, DHS has led multiple engagements focused on addressing community concerns related to DVE, Department strategy, and incidents of hate targeting specific communities. In April 2023, OPE hosted a virtual Ramadan engagement with American Muslim community leaders to solicit their feedback, concerns, and insights on DHS policies and programs. In March 2023, DHS launched the Prevention Resource Finder, providing stakeholders with information on the <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">resources</span> needed to help prepare for and prevent targeted violence and terrorism across our country. 5. Filing Complaints and Seeking Redress in DHS Programs and Activities. DHS continues to enhance communication with the public regarding the ability to file complaints concerning DHS programs and seek redress without retaliation, how these processes work, and what individuals can expect from these processes. OPE, CRCL, and the DHS Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO) continue to hold engagement events for the public, including underserved communities, to provide more information about the various DHS complaint processes. In March 2023, CRCL launched a new online complaint portal, with prompts available in 10 languages. The portal accepts complaints in any language and also notes the availability of interpreters and translators for any language. In accordance with Section 9 (c) of Executive Order 14074, Advancing Effective Accountable Policing and Criminal Justice Practices to Enhance Public Trust and Public Safety, DHS <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">law</span> enforcement agencies will continue to ensure that effective </p></article>

<p>6. Airport Screening. In furtherance of TSA's mission to protect the Nation's transportation systems and facilitate lawful travel, TSA has enhanced and standardized training for its screening officers and has improved its screening technology capabilities to reduce the possibility of bias against travelers and increase safety. TSA deployed new Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) software for screening systems at airports across the country. This update eliminates the need for Transportation Security Officers to determine a passenger's gender prior to AIT screening and is projected to reduce the instances of enhanced screening for transgender persons and members of other underserved communities. TSA has held multiple community engagements to enhance communication with the traveling public and increase awareness of security procedures. 7. Trusted Traveler Programs. DHS has taken steps to advance equity in its Trusted Traveler Programs. TSA updated the PreCheck application <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">process</span> by allowing individuals to select their gender marker based on self - attestation, regardless of sex assigned at birth. The application was updated to include additional gender marker options to better serve non - binary and gender non - conforming travelers. 8. Public Assistance. FEMA has advanced equity as a foundation for public assistance. In August 2022, FEMA's Office for Public Assistance released the Operational Draft of the Public Assistance Program Delivery Guide, which included considerations for FEMA recipients and applicants to conduct response and recovery efforts in an equitable manner. The Guide includes a performance metric for the prioritization of communities rated as highly socially vulnerable, including underserved rural areas. From April 2021 through August 2022, FEMA's Office for Equal Rights worked with the Office for Public Assistance on its mission to ensure an equitable response to the COVID - 19 pandemic. FEMA established the Civil Rights Advisory Group as part of the agency's commitment to the COVID - 19 vaccination mission amid the ongoing battle against the pandemic. The advisory group's mission is to evaluate the policies, practices, strategies, and plans in place to ensure equity in vaccine <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> and administration. 9. Achieving Equitable Outcomes for Disaster Survivors. FEMA continues to advance equitable outcomes for disaster survivors. FEMA is working to identify and include considerations for traditionally underserved or marginalized communities in the forms, processes, and online Grants Portal system that the agency uses to support applicants. </p></article>

<p>FEMA is redeveloping the way it collects, documents, and processes information from applicants to be less burdensome, more effective, and more equitable in the distribution of Public Assistance. Moving forward, FEMA will work to clarify the recipient's legal responsibility and to structure a more comprehensive reporting <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">process</span> SO that recipients and subrecipients clearly understand their obligations to develop and report on their strategies for equitable response and recovery. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) selected Recovering from a Disaster as a Life Experience Project in 2022. Discovery work was completed to inform how FEMA could create an equitable and less frustrating experience to survivors while they are enduring trauma. Based on recommendations made from the discovery work, the General Services Administration is currently partnering with FEMA to measure end - to - end burden placed on natural disaster survivors. 10. Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP). NSGP provides <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">funding</span> for physical security enhancements to nonprofit organizations, including houses of worship, that are at high risk of terrorist attack. FEMA has improved equitable <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> to NSGP <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">funding</span> by improving participation from nonprofit organizations serving underserved communities and embedding equity considerations in the grant review <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">process</span>. FEMA continues to engage in robust outreach and engagement efforts throughout the NSGP lifecycle to ensure that nonprofit organizations have the information they need to apply. In FY 2022, NSGP held 82 events, including webinars, with over 18,039 unique participants to increase understanding of the application <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">process</span> and eligibility for subrecipients. In June 2023, FEMA published an informative video about applying to the NSGP, available both on YouTube.com and FEMA.gov. FEMA has collaborated with other federal and nonprofit partners to further amplify this engagement and messaging, including the DHS Center for Faith - Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, Department of Justice (DOJ) Community Relations Service, religious and cultural organizations, HBCUs, and Minority Serving Institutions. In FY 2023, FEMA advanced considerations of equity in awarding NSGP grant <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">funding</span> by adding up to 15 additional points to the scores of organizations that demonstrate how they serve an underserved community or population or that are located within an underserved community. Additionally, applicants who had never received NSGP <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">funding</span> had 15 points added to their project score (a scoring metric continued from FY 2022). </p></article>

<p>Creation of NIST's generative AI profile for the Risk Management Framework. NIST established the National Al Advisory Committee (NAIAC), a group of experts tasked with advising the President and the National Al Initiative Office on topics related to Al. This includes matters related to the use of Al in <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">law</span> enforcement and legal standards, such as those ensuring that Al use is consistent with privacy rights, civil rights and civil liberties, and disability rights. NIST intends to develop a generative Al profile for the Risk Management Framework to help entities apply the framework to the creation of new, advanced generative Al models. Address harmful biases throughout the AI system lifecycle. In May, NIST and NSF launched the Institute for Trustworthy Al in <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">Law</span> and Society (TRAILS), a partnership between the University of Maryland, George Washington, and Morgan State University. NIST and NSF will invest $ 20 million over five years for TRAILS to focus on how ethics and human rights can drive Al development and governance. Importantly, a key pillar of TRAILS will be input and feedback from marginalized communities. </p></article>

<p>The most persistent barrier to the establishment, expansion, and growth of minority business enterprises (MBEs) continues to be <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> to capital. The U.S. Federal Reserve found that more than half of Black - owned businesses were turned down for private bank loans, a rate twice as high as white business owners. A Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies study found that 6 in 10 Black business owners faced challenges obtaining capital. Over a third of Latino business owners faced the same.

Innovation fueled economic growth in America for the past century, but since the 1970s, innovation (as measured by fundamental productivity growth) appears to have slowed from an annual increase of 1.9 percent to 0.7 percent. Research shows that innovation in the U.S. could quadruple if women, minorities, and children from low - income families became inventors at the same rate as men from high - income families. According to the USPTO, that increase in inventorship would grow our economy and GDP by an estimated $ 1 trillion.

<p>Closed 13 FY 2021 Cooperative Agreements (CAs) in Q4 2023. At the beginning of Q2 2023, DoD finalized and approved the FY 2023 Short List of NALEMP projects and budgets for 14 Federally Recognized Tribes. The Short List is a list of Tribes with eligible sites that have been approved for NALEMP <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">funding</span> to address past DoD environmental impacts on Indian lands and other locations where DoD, an Indian tribe, and the current landowner agree that such mitigation is appropriate. These FY 2023 CAs are expected to be executed by Q4 2023. Additionally, NALEMP is currently considering 16 Tribes for FY 2024 CAs. Completed over half of the Preliminary Assessments / Site Inspections (PA / SI) at 707 installations where DoD may have used and potentially released PFAS materials. DoD obligated $ 2.0 billion (B) through FY 2022 to conduct PFAS - related drinking water mitigation, investigations, and cleanup on its installations, as well as in nearby communities. Awarded three non - construction planning and organization assistance grants to Guam in FY 2022 totaling $ 2.3 million (M) to address cumulative DoD socioeconomic and environmental impacts in Guam. Provided approximately $ 218M in appropriated <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">funding</span> for outside - the - fence investments in Guam, including a cultural repository ($ 12M), public health lab ($ 32M), upgrades to the Northern District Wastewater Treatment Plant ($ 139.3M), Interceptor Sewer Refurbishment ($ 30.6M), Northern Guam Lens Aquifer Monitoring System ($ 3.7M), and surface transportation network improvements ($ 246M). Three of the five Guam outside - the - fence investments are complete, one is under construction, and one is completing final design. All projects are estimated to be completed by 2025. Initiated a robust environmental cleanup communication and outreach effort to improve transparency and engage communities affected by DoD's cleanup activities. </p></article>

<p>EERE released its HBCU Clean Energy Education Prize during May 2023. This competition, with $ 7.75M in cash prizes, will help HBCU institutions develop programming to strengthen the participation of K - 12 and community college students in STEM and other associated fields that can lead to potential careers in clean energy industries. It will also give HBCUs the opportunity to create enhanced curricula and programs that will provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and establish partnerships that lead to career opportunities in clean energy. This prize supports President Biden's Justice40 Initiative, which directs 40 % of the overall benefits of certain federal investments to flow to disadvantaged communities, by helping to build a diverse STEM pipeline to support the clean energy transition. The prize aims to help HBCUs achieve these goals through two distinct prize tracks, the Inspire Track and the Partnerships Track. HBCUs of all sizes are invited to apply to help foster the next generation of the clean energy technical workforce. Details can be found at the Prize website: HBCU Clean Energy Education Prize HeroX. In FY 2023, EERE's first cohort of 11 students from the Graduate Education for Minority Students fellowship (GEM Fellowship) program, a non - governmental program, started their 10 - week summer internship assignments in various EERE program offices. The goal of the GEM Fellowship program is to enhance the value of the Nation's human capital by increasing the participation of underrepresented groups at the master's and doctoral levels in engineering and science. The FY 2023 program follows EERE's pilot program, which established GEM Fellow cohorts in a partnership pilot between EERE's Building Technologies Office and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. This is the first class of GEM Fellowship students within DOE. EERE's Interagency Agreement with the Army and the MSI STEM R & D Consortium was designed to increase <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">funding</span> opportunities for MSIs.

Progress on improving <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> and equity in DOE's Weatherization Assistance Program. DOE created the Office of State and Community Energy Programs to administer state and community - facing programs, including the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP). The following bullets outline key accomplishments in WAP since the publication of the April 2022 EAP. On February 3, 2023, DOE published allocations of $ 30M for Weatherization Readiness from the FY 2023 WAP appropriation, an increase of $ 15M from FY 2022. DOE WAP and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) launched a Weatherization Workforce Development Pilot in February 2023 to enhance impact in four communities: Lowell, MA; Roanoke, VA; Chicago, IL; and Warner Robins, GA. The program connects HUD residents to weatherization jobs within Community Action Agencies and sets up residents for careers in green construction. This partnership aims to support the utilization of DOE Weatherization Assistance Program funds by adequately staffing the weatherization programs in local communities. Several of the communities have begun hosting job fairs to share information and recruit HUD residents interested in weatherization work.

<p>In July 2023, DOE announced the 67 winners of the first phase of the Energizing Rural Communities Prize. The cohort included 17 Tribes, or teams, serving Tribal communities. Each of the 67 winners will receive $ 100,000, in - kind - mentorship services, and eligibility to compete in phase two of the prize to win an additional $ 200,000. One of the winning teams is Sustainable Energy for Galena Alaska, a nonprofit run jointly by the Louden Tribal Council, the Galena City School District, and the City of Galena. See Community Profile: What Energizing Rural Communities Means for Galena, Alaska. About 400 people live in Galena year - round, and the economy is based around the schools there that draw over 50 villages ' high school students for boarding school. DOE is <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">funding</span> holistic energy planning for Sustainable Energy for Galena Alaska. DOE's participation in the Rural Partners Network (RPN), which is led by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the White House Rural Prosperity Interagency <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">Policy</span> Council, builds relationships with rural communities across the Nation, especially in the states and communities designated to be prioritized by RPN. DOE employs a Rural Desk Officer, who actively participates in the network. One component of the RPN is the selection of signature projects in communities that have been identified by the network as priority areas. For example, DOE is the lead for the San Carlos Apache Tribe's solar project, which was awarded $ 4M in FY 2023 year. Upon completion, the project will add 750 kW of solar photovoltaic systems and a 500 - kW Battery Energy Storage System to its diesel generators to serve 36 residential buildings for healthcare workers and five hospital buildings at the San Carlos Apache Healthcare Corporation community. DOE has several offices that offer programs that directly benefit rural communities by providing technical assistance, loans, tax incentives and <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">funding</span> that supports the clean energy transition. Some examples include: The Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), which manages the Energy Improvements in Rural or Remote Areas program that supports energy investments in rural and remote areas through clean energy projects to improve reliability and / or resilience of energy systems, reduce energy poverty, and improve environmental performance of energy generation in rural or remote communities.

<p>Current metric collection fails to holistically assess justice outcomes in DOE R & D programs. Current Justice40 metrics do not capture R & D impacts outside of the geographical location where work is being performed. Further, some types of R & D <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">funding</span> (non - competitive / block grants, DOE Laboratory solicitations, Lab field work proposals) do not have metrics in place to monitor and measure project progress. Justice40 metric reporting is hindered by limited coordination and some offices lacking trained and task - dedicated personnel to measure program impacts. The nature of R & D makes outcome - based metric reporting difficult. Outcome - based metrics are data that show the extent and impact of an organization's, program's, or initiative's activities on its customers or beneficiaries. 5 Outcome - based metrics are different from performance metrics, which track the key activities that lead to outcomes, or output or activity data, which describe the organization's actions. 6 Outcome - based metrics are useful for demonstrating accountability, transparency, and efficacy. 7 The benefits of R & D can have long time horizons and broad applications. In general, technology R & D strategy roadmaps lack sufficient consideration of equity or justice. Current roadmaps emphasize technological advancement of high - performance, high - cost technologies that likely will not be affordable to underserved communities. For example, clean energy and energy efficiency programs (e.g., rooftop solar power, weatherization) are not <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">accessible</span> to some underserved and underrepresented communities, especially where there is a reliance upon technology to communicate and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> these programs.

<p>Although inconsistent, several offices across DOE have collected R & D impact metrics, such as the number of peer - reviewed journal articles, patents, licenses, new companies formed, and the amount of follow - on <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">funding</span> received from the private sector. Challenges to these current efforts include: Many of these achievements occur after a project is closed out, when awardees are no longer reporting on the project and have likely moved onto other projects. As a result, many of these outputs are not appropriately attributed to DOE <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">funding</span>. One study of the Web of Science - a public database of scientific articles - found that in some subject areas, as little as 28 % of the articles had any acknowledgements, and of those only 65 % acknowledged <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">funding</span>. 9 If <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">funding</span> is properly acknowledged, web - crawling techniques can be used to extract subsequent impacts. Existing project impact metrics fail to address equity or justice. There are infrequent third - party reviews of evaluation metrics. These reviews are costly, time - intensive, and limited by confidential business information restrictions. There is limited interaction and participation with citizen / community science in the development of DOE R & D strategies and metrics. There have been several approaches across the federal Government to address the foregoing challenges: In the Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA - E), there are staff who follow up with past recipients to collect research outputs / publications. In the DOE Office of Science, there is an annual automated reminder to past awardees to update their profile, including information regarding publications. Existing literature shows a lack of equity consideration in R & D metrics. To fill this gap, NREL developed the Justice Underpinning Science and Technology Research (JUST - R) metrics framework - energy justice metrics specifically targeted at early - stage research. 10 Some offices have project - specific metrics. For example, DOE's Building Technology Office requires applicants of some FOAs to provide estimates of energy, cost, and emissions savings using the Resilient and Efficient Codes Implementation (RECI) Impact Calculator tool - a spreadsheet - based tool for building code updates in new construction, improvements to existing buildings, and improvements in energy codes compliance. 11 Since climate change disproportionately impacts low - income and minority </p></article>

Progress on addressing gaps in data collection to facilitate data - informed decision - making. Office of Management, Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) OAM implemented an agency - wide BIL <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">funding</span> opportunity announcement (FOA) template for BIL and IRA actions to further the Administration's goals to advance equity, provide support for disadvantaged communities, and leverage federal <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">resources</span> to achieve these objectives. The FOA template includes a Community Benefits Plan requirement, along with requirements to collect equity and justice - focused data. OAM, the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU), and the National Nuclear Safety Administration are co - leading an Acquisition Forecast Improvement Working Group to establish a centralized, web - based platform capturing all contracting, subcontracting and financial assistance opportunities at DOE and better reach underrepresented businesses in DOE <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">procurement</span> opportunities. ii. Progress on increasing opportunities for new applicants to DOE <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">funding</span> opportunities. Office of Management, OAM OAM implemented a strategy with M & O contractors and major site and facility contractors designed to increase subcontracting opportunities from contractors who employ people who are blind or have significant disabilities (AbilityOne). As a result of this implementation, DOE - wide AbilityOne obligations increased from $ 27.5M in FY 2022 to $ 31.2M in FY 2023, an increase of 13 %. OAM continues to co - lead the Innovative <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">Funding</span> Mechanisms Working Group with the Office of General Counsel, which is exploring innovative mechanisms to increase participation in DOE <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">funding</span> opportunities. The Working Group has focused on Partnership Intermediary Agreements (PIAs) and Other Transactions (OT) Authority as possible pathways to reach underrepresented entities and communities. PIAs are best utilized when traditional contractual mechanisms do not provide adequate outreach with non - traditional contractors and can reduce barriers to entry for such entities. DOE has put a Pilot PIA agreement in place to extend the Department's reach to new entrants and non - traditional partners, as well as small business firms, universities, and non - profit organizations. The agency has awarded one project utilizing the PIA mechanism, and additional projects are in the planning phase. Additionally, the agency has developed an OT guide for DOE program offices to increase the utilization of OT Authorities department wide. The agency anticipates that these interventions will increase contracting opportunities with new entrants and non - traditional partners.

<p>In FY 2022, SC launched Reaching a New Energy Sciences Workforce (RENEW) to establish a more targeted and intentional approach to building foundations to support undergraduate and graduate student training opportunities and support institutions historically underrepresented in the SC research portfolio. RENEW leverages the agency's unique National Laboratories, user facilities, and other research infrastructures to provide training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty. In FY 2022, SC announced 41 RENEW awards totaling $ 32M to 37 institutions, including 24 MSIs. In FY 2023, SC issued seven RENEW solicitations and awarded $ 70M in <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">funding</span> to 65 institutions, including 40 MSIs.

The BLM issued an " " Instruction Memorandum about Environmental Justice Implementation " " and " " Addressing Environmental Justice in NEPA FAQs " " in September 2022. These documents update and formalize best practices while recommending methods for scoping, outreach, and analysis in environmental reviews.

<p>In advancing this strategy, the Department will take steps to promote meaningful engagement in implementing the Department's Comprehensive Environmental Justice Enforcement Strategy by partnering with historically marginalized and underserved persons, communities with LEP, and those with disabilities who are experiencing justice and climate - related concerns. For example, OEJ has led community listening sessions in support of DOJ's lawsuit to improve safe drinking water <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> in Jackson, Mississippi, and developed community outreach best practices for case teams across the country. 63 OEJ will continue to organize and participate in non - case specific engagement sessions and serve as a resource for environmental enforcement case - related outreach to communities burdened by environmental hazards. </p></article>

<p>Historically, these communities have faced barriers in their attempts to engage with Federal agencies, either due to agency practices, policies, systems, and infrastructure, or barriers too often endemic to historically marginalized and underserved communities, such as lack of internet <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span>, transportation, time, capacity, and financial <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">resources</span>.

<p>Research shows that through <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">funding</span> and technical assistance, population - specific organizations can play a significant role in effectively implementing system strategies.

<p>A. 2022 Equity Action Plan Update Pursuant to EO 13985, 2 the Department of Justice published its first ever Equity Action Plan in April 2022. Since then, the Department has made significant progress implementing its equity priorities by improving solicitation processes, increasing opportunities for disadvantaged small businesses located in Historically Underutilized Business Zones, and strengthening mechanisms for community engagement, among others. Specific examples of the Department's ongoing progress in advancing its 2022 equity priorities include: Strengthening efforts to ensure compliance and enforcement of non - discrimination laws. Following review of implementation and administrative enforcement of the non - discrimination provisions set forth in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act ³ and the Safe Streets Act4 in connection with Federal financial assistance, the Department is taking affirmative steps to improve this work. 5 For example, the Civil Rights Division (CRT) and the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) created and co - chair a Compliance Working Group to coordinate the implementation and enforcement of these statutes, issue public guidance, revise internal standards, update tools and <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">resources</span>, and conduct public outreach. 6 Enhancing language <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> for individuals with limited English proficiency.

<p>Within the past year, DOL agencies have engaged meaningfully with stakeholders and community partners; this has intrinsically informed our approach to the Equity Action Plan. We conducted strategic meetings with workers, community leaders, and businesses within the Southeast, and found that workers were significantly more likely to face wage violations and fewer worker protections, as well as decreased coalition building. In April 2023, we held an extensive workshop with stakeholders to brainstorm and discuss solutions for employment rates among formerly incarcerated individuals, which will inform our work to increase <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> to pilot job readiness trainings for this underserved demographic.

BIL authorized a total of up to $ 660.8 billion for DOT over five years across dozens of programs and DOT received a total of $ 5.6 billion for four programs under the IRA. DOT is embedding equity across BIL and IRA programs through the various strategies outlined in this Equity Action Plan, including a focus on meaningful public involvement, technical assistance, and data and tools to inform decision - making. Together, BIL and IRA will help create more livable communities and further advance transportation equity. </p></article>

The RFI asked for public comment on four questions related to equity performance metrics, data sets, tools, research, and examples of impacts and partnerships. DOT received 69 comments from organizations, government agencies, companies, and individuals across the country. Some key themes from responses to the RFI included: DOT should take a more ambitious approach to setting actions and performance measures regarding equity. DOT's goals in the Equity Action Plan should address safety, climate change, community engagement, <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">accessibility</span>, and workforce development. </p></article>

<p>Measuring <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> and system condition should be further developed in DOT's ETC Explorer and other tools that can help increase availability of information. By disaggregating data, DOT and stakeholders could better analyze impacts and equity concerns at a local level. It can be challenging to compare results of different equity tools because of differences in definitions, datasets, scales, or measurements. Technical assistance is important in supporting underserved communities, local community - based organizations, and first - time grant applicants to successfully secure and administer federal grants. In - Person and Virtual Public Dialogues: DOT held an in - person public dialogue at DOT Headquarters in Washington, D.C., on June 20, 2023. The event included participation by 65 external attendees. The event was open to the public and included remarks from DOT leadership, a question and answer (Q & A) session, and an " " open house " " period wherein attendees had an opportunity to meet DOT staff who work across modes in the equity space. A virtual public dialogue was held on June 23, 2023, and followed a similar format. The virtual dialogue had 562 attendees, with attendees from all 50 states and the District of Columbia, from government agencies, trade associations, community advocacy groups, educational institutions, private companies, and other types of organizations. The events helped participants better understand DOT's equity work and respond to the RFI. </p></article>

<p>Education can have a transformational impact on an individual's life - and education plays a vital role in easing an individual's reentry from jail or prison back into society. Studies have found that a postsecondary education helps justice - impacted people who were formerly incarcerated find jobs upon release, support their families, and contribute positively to their communities. Research also shows that <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> to education in prison lowers the odds of recidivating by 43 percent and saves taxpayers up to $ 5 for every $ 1 spent. 26 However, policies have traditionally exacerbated the barriers that incarcerated people face when attempting to continue their education, including inadequate <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">funding</span>, local labor market trends and employer needs, statutory and administrative restrictions, and a lack of incentives and support to promote participation in education. 27 </p></article>

<p>This Equity Action Plan reflects our efforts to address persistent opportunity gaps and build a better education system than the one we had before the pandemic and embodies the Department's " " Raise the Bar: Lead the World " " agenda. First, thanks to President Biden's historic investments in public education, including providing $ 122 billion in American Rescue Plan (ARP) funds for Title I Schools, this plan includes supporting State and local efforts to accelerate learning and provide a comprehensive, rigorous, and academically excellent education to every student. Second, we're improving learning conditions with new efforts to elevate, grow, and diversify the teaching profession, leveraging the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act's bold investments to help address chronic absenteeism, better supporting students ' mental health and positive school climates, and advancing robust parent and family engagement in schools. Third, we're focused on creating opportunities for students of all backgrounds to succeed in our globally competitive society and by investing in multilingual learning and reimagining pathways to college and careers. Finally, we are working to increase college affordability and completion SO that all students have <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> to quality, postsecondary education that leads to careers that provide economic mobility and stability. </p></article>

Making it easier to fill out the FAFSA can address one of the key barriers to enrolling in college for students of color and low - income students. 15 Affordability: Research has found that a $ 1,000 increase in grant aid can increase college enrollment by 4 percentage points, and that a $ 1,000 increase in need - based grant aid can increase college completion by nearly 4 percentage points.

Designated the $ 1 billion from the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA) as the Stronger Connections Grant Program. This enables SEAs to competitively award subgrants to high - need LEAs for activities to support safe and healthy students under ESEA section 4108. Funded 264 grants with $ 1 billion in BSCA funds to more than 40 states to increase the supply of school - based mental health professionals under the School - Based Mental Health Services Grant and the Mental Health Services Professional Demonstration (MHSPD) Grant Program. At least 40 States used " " high poverty " " in their definition of high - needs school. The Department estimates these 5 - year grants will result in an increase of 14,000 mental health professionals. In FY23, nearly 50 percent of the MHSPD grants include a partnership with MSIs, HBCUs, or Tribal Colleges.

The Department issued revised non - regulatory guidance to inform SEAs, LEAs, institutions of higher education, schools, educators, partner organizations, and other stakeholders on how they can use evidence - based activities, strategies, and interventions to strengthen education investments. The Department also published a training to inform grantees of sourcing requirements for capital improvements authorized by the Build America Buy America Act (BABAA). </p></article>

<p>The Environmental Protection Agency's 2023 Equity Action Plan reflects our Agency's unwavering commitment to embed equity, civil rights, and environmental justice into all aspects of our work. At EPA, we recognize that fulfilling our mission of protecting human health and the environment depends on our ability to protect and lift up communities with environmental justice concerns that have long been overburdened by pollution. In our FY 2022 - 2026 Strategic Plan, we renewed our commitment to the three <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">principles</span> articulated at the founding of the Agency: follow the science, follow the <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">law</span>, and be transparent, and we added a fourth foundational principle: advance justice and equity. Including this fourth principle reflects the critical need to infuse the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all people into EPA's policies, practices, and programs. </p></article>

<p>EPA envisions a future where all parts of society are increasingly engaged in science and use these data to inform environmental public health and environmental protection actions on local, regional, and national scales. Community - based participatory science is defined as scientific research designed, implemented, and used by the community, often in collaboration with scientists. These efforts facilitate community prioritization, understanding, and use of data to garner <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">resources</span> and inform actions to solve their environmental challenges. Participatory science results in an increase in place - based connections, environmental stewardship, and scientific literacy. Community based participatory science projects engage community members in problem solving and lead to better outcomes for communities. 32 Community - based participatory science is a core component of the EPA Participatory Science Vision. </p></article>

<p>Advancing equity, environmental justice, and civil rights compliance is integral to EPA's mission to protect the health and the environment of all people in the United States and its territories. In its Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 - 2026 Strategic Plan, EPA renewed its commitment to the agency's core <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">principles</span> - follow the science, follow the <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">law</span>, and be transparent - while adding a fourth principle, advance justice, and equity. To carry out its mission, EPA is committed to developing and implementing concrete policies and activities to advance equity and environmental justice across its programs. This can only be achieved by acknowledging that many communities across the country have not sufficiently benefitted from EPA's decades of progress in reducing pollution and breaking down barriers to equity. EPA strives to infuse the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals into all EPA programs, policies, and activities. EPA's commitment to equity and environmental justice forms a critical foundation on which to build meaningful engagement with communities with environmental justice concerns; achieve more equitable and just outcomes, including pollution reductions in communities with environmental justice concerns; and deliver other tangible benefits. In remaining faithful to these commitments, EPA is living up to the promise to protect human health and the environment made to all people in the United States and its territories when the Agency was created more than 50 years ago. </p></article>

<p>In March 2022, reached a settlement with Chevron Phillips Chemical Company to install and operate air pollution controls at three petrochemical manufacturing facilities in Texas located in areas of environmental justice concern; monitoring results will be publicly posted, and corrective actions are required if emissions exceed certain thresholds. Took aggressive, early enforcement actions in communities with environmental justice concerns: In August 2022, following negotiations that considered concerns voiced by the local community, secured a preliminary injunction for the Toa Alta Municipal Solid Waste Landfill to take immediate action to address urgent human health and environmental concerns. Issued two Clean Air Act emergency orders to shut down the Limetree Refinery in the U.S. Virgin Islands (June 2021) where residents were sickened by excess sulfur and hydrogen sulfide emissions and to cut hydrogen sulfide emissions from the New Indy plant in South Carolina (May 2021). Provided more enforcement information to communities about facilities, pollution, and enforcement activities through press releases, desk statements, public meetings, and websites focused on specific communities and incidents (e.g., Refinery on St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, H2S in South and North Carolina, Toa Alta Landfill in Puerto Rico). Increased efforts to obtain input from communities on potential remedies prior to finalizing settlement agreements. Developed analytical approaches to address environmental justice implications of major regulatory proposals and final rules. For example, For the Oil and Natural Gas New Source Performance Standard proposal (November 2021) and the Supplemental Proposal (November 2022), EPA held virtual trainings (900 + participants) marketed to communities with environmental justice concerns and Tribes to assist their ability to understand and comment meaningfully on the proposal. EPA's proposal included requirements for states to undertake meaningful outreach and engagement with communities with environmental justice concerns as they develop their plans for regulating existing oil and gas sources under the emissions guidelines. In the final nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission standards for trucks, conducted analyses of the number and demographics of the populations living within close proximity to truck freight routes. This final <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">rule</span> will likely result in widespread air quality improvements across the U.S., especially in areas already overburdened by air pollution and diesel emissions, beginning with model year 2027. In July 2023, issued proposed rules to strengthen lead paint standards to protect against childhood lead exposure. Developed a Strategy to Reduce Lead Exposures and Disparities in US Communities to advance EPA's work to protect the public from lead with an emphasis on high - risk communities. Announced the allotment of $ 2.865B FY 2023 funds from the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund for identification and replacement of lead service lines (LSLs). As part of the Lead Service Line Replacement (LSLR) Accelerators, EPA and 4 state partners are working with 40 communities to address existing barriers and accelerate progress towards LSL identification and replacement. The new Accelerator provides targeted technical assistance services to help communities with environmental justice concerns <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> funds from President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law4 and this initiative will prioritize benefits to communities with EJ concerns and promote equity.

<p>subgrants to communities in their regional coverage areas in amounts between $ 100 - 350K. These subgrants will essentially replace EPA's traditional grant programs such as the EJ Small Grants, which would provide such small levels of support directly to communities through a traditional government grant competition and award <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">process</span>. The subawards through the Grantmakers will achieve two equity goals - greatly reducing the burden capacity - constrained communities face when seeking small amounts of <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">funding</span> directly from the federal government, and also increasing the speed with which communities receive an award. EPA plans to make at least eleven (11) Grantmaker awards across the United States with $ 50M each, of which at least $ 40M must be directly subawarded to capacity - constrained communities. EPA anticipates that over the next three years the Grantmakers will make approximately 2,000 subawards in the amounts cited. EPA has announced the eleven (11) recipients of the EJ TCGM awards totaling $ 600M. Launched a new $ 2B Environment and Climate Justice Community Change Grant program with a focus on re - envisioning the application <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">process</span> to ensure equity. In FY 2024, EPA will compete these new Community Change Grants, which will be the vehicle through which approximately $ 2B in IRA <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">funding</span> will flow. Community Change Grants will focus on awarding between $ 10 - 20M to multi - faceted proposals from community - driven collaborations that bring together efforts to deal with legacy pollution, the impacts of climate change, development of local workforces, meaningful engagement, community education - all with a goal of implementing solutions that create positive change on the ground for communities. EPA is implementing several innovative solutions to increase equity through this program. While the EJ TCTACs will focus on providing more basic forms of support to capacity - constrained communities, they will also facilitate communities with higher levels of capacity to <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> more specialized forms of technical assistance provided by contractors. This contractor - provided technical assistance will offer communities the support they need for planning, project development, financing, etc. in the development of multi - faceted proposals for the Community Change Grant program. Technical assistance by the contractor will also support proposals that receive support to ensure high quality reporting, tracking, and telling the story of how the Community Change Grants catalyzed positive and meaningful change on the ground for the recipient communities. The Community Change Grant program will have a two - stage application <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">process</span>. The first stage will be a more traditional written application that is streamlined to the extent feasible to ease the burden on applicants. Proposals that meet minimum criteria in the paper application will then be invited to an oral presentation that will achieve two goals - minimize the role that professional grant writers play for typically better - resourced communities and allow EPA grants staff to engage directly with community leaders and their partners to investigate the authenticity of the project's community - driven nature and the sustainability ensured by different partners of the project. In addition - to ease the burden on communities - the Community Change Grant will have a 12 - month open application period. This will achieve several equity goals. It will provide communities significantly more time to build the partnerships and multi - faceted proposals sought through this competition. It will allow EPA program staff the opportunity to tailor the competition over the year - long window based upon feedback from prospective applicants and the actual proposals received to ensure that the competition fits the needs and purpose as closely as possible.

<p>The Federal real estate footprint - including the 375 million rentable square feet owned and operated by GSA - has significant generational impact on communities nationwide. Federal construction projects act as anchors for economic security, reliable opportunities for good local jobs, defenses against the negative impacts of climate change, and can advance the overall livability and vitality of American communities. GSA's work often occurs in or adjacent to disadvantaged communities that have suffered from long - standing underinvestment and have dealt with historic challenges and barriers to equitable development. These communities tend to have poor transportation connectivity to job opportunities, higher exposure to many forms of pollution, and less <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> to green space. The impacts of this inequity are apparent in the persistent lower household income, high unemployment, and poorer health outcomes. 8 In order to help overcome these barriers, GSA is executing projects with enhanced stakeholder engagement and data analysis to better inform GSA decisionmakers and project teams about local development contexts and better connect project location, design, and facility operations with the needs of those communities that will benefit from more equitable development. </p></article>

Examples include both lack of <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> to the newest hardware or good internet, which often means newer digital platforms do not perform as well (because they are not built for older devices or don't work with low bandwidth connections), or software that is not designed to work across all populations, such as lack of plain language impacting populations with limited English proficiency or poorly trained Al models causing biometric systems to perform worse for people with different ages or skin tones.

<p>The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP) was designed to address immediate needs related to the COVID - 19 pandemic, with a specific focus on addressing historically disparate outcomes across race, class, and geography that were further exacerbated by the pandemic. To support the Federal Government's exploration of questions about equitable recovery, GSA's Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) established an ARP Evaluation Portfolio with two core elements: a national evaluation conducted by a third - party research contract, and a portfolio of evaluations conducted by OES, in partnership with agencies and the White House Office of Management and Budget, on ARP - funded programs with equity goals. This body of work explores effectiveness of critical relief programs like Emergency Rental Assistance and Homeowner Assistance Fund. The Bipartisan Infrastructure <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">Law</span> (BIL) provides $ 3.4 billion for GSA's Public Buildings Service, making a significant impact on 26 Land Ports of Entry modernizations along the Canadian and Mexican border. These projects will create new good - paying jobs, bolster safety and security, and make our economy more resilient to supply chain challenges - all while serving as models for sustainability and innovation and improving community livability. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provides GSA with $ 2.15 billion for low - embodied carbon materials in construction and renovation projects, $ 975 million for GSA to support emerging and sustainable technologies, and $ 250 million to turn even more GSA facilities into High - Performance Green Buildings and accelerate efforts to achieve a net - zero Federal footprint. These investments will reduce long - term energy costs for American communities, strengthen America's domestic industrial base and catalyze innovation and job growth in homegrown industries that produce next - generation materials, products, and equipment. GSA estimates that these projects will create over 9,500 average annual economy - wide jobs across the length of the projects, support $ 2.8 billion in labor income, and generate nearly $ 1 billion in tax revenue for Federal, State and local governments. </p></article>

<p>Create new sustainability - focused markets in coordination with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Defense. Climate risk adaptation efforts and Federal sustainability goals are positioned to deploy hundreds of millions of dollars in new acquisition opportunities, including those available to small businesses, over the near / medium term. GSA is driving new and emerging market successes in Low Embodied Carbon building materials, Zero - Emission Vehicles and supply equipment, scaling of eco - labels to reduce per - and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and expediting <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">procurement</span> availability of environmental technologies. Finalize solicitations and awards for new Polaris and OASIS + contracts. 3 These newly launched governmentwide IT and professional services contracts offer more opportunities for small businesses to compete for prime contracts, including small business and socioeconomic set - asides. Since 2015, GSA's current OASIS vehicle has helped Federal agencies obligate more than $ 67 billion. Improve <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">accessibility</span> and reduce administrative burden. GSA committed to reviewing 37 Federal Acquisition <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">Regulation</span> (FAR) forms and identifying six design changes to appearance and layout (e.g., limiting use of capitalization and italics, continuity of 12 - point font and bolded text for readability) that could make the standard forms easier to navigate for people with dyslexia, limited vision and intellectual disabilities. GSA will redesign FAR forms and launch a public awareness campaign about the updates. For FY 2024, GSA will also increase its pledge to the AbilityOne program, a critical source for buying goods and services from suppliers who support the employment of people with disabilities. Further implement and enhance the Post - Award Engagement (PAE) Strategy. Fiscal Year 2023 sales data for SDBs and SESBs will serve as the Year 1 baseline to evaluate the efficacy of PAE plan activities. Based on analysis, GSA will update actions for post - award interventions that address the phenomena of persistent low or no sales, including: targeted training, matchmaking industry days and technical assistance. </p></article>

What we collectively learned from that Challenge is that we have more work to do, such as identifying and correcting gaps in our data standards to address equity, communicating more effectively with diverse audiences, and strengthening our role in facilitating an inclusive health and human services workforce. HHS is actively advancing these efforts and making the question of whether our reach is for everyone's benefit a central part of how we continuously improve our services. </p></article>

They correspond with HHS 2022 - 2026 strategic plan and key Biden - Harris Administration priorities for HHS. The plan also sits in parallel to specific efforts related to equity within HHS's family of agencies, such as the National Institute of Health's strategic plan for diversity, equity, inclusion, and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">accessibility</span>, the Administration for Children and Families ' equity in action commitments, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's CORE commitment to equity and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ' framework for equity.

<p>Preventing Child Welfare System Involvement: We understand that families in poverty and those in Tribal and other communities are impacted by the child welfare system more than others, in some cases largely because they lack sufficient <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> to economic <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">resources</span> and community networks. Our efforts will be directed at connecting families in need to supports that enable them to stay together and preventing discriminatory and other practices that make it difficult for children, youth, and families to heal when child welfare is involved. Promoting <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">Accessible</span> and Welcoming Health Care: A lack of health insurance coverage and social and geographic barriers to care mean that not everyone is receiving health care that meets their needs within their communities.

Improving Maternal Health Outcomes: Too many women, particularly racial and ethnic minority populations, and those in rural areas, are losing their lives or health during pregnancy or after giving birth. Our actions will address gaps in insurance coverage and the birthing care infrastructure to ensure better maternal health outcomes. Meeting Behavioral Health Needs: The impact of the COVID - 19 pandemic increased mental health and substance use challenges for all populations, but disproportionately exacerbated the already existing behavioral health disparities among underserved racial, ethnic, and sexual minority populations. The rising rates of suicide, depression, anxiety, and substance misuse among youth and adults are impacted by a decreasing workforce, limited <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">resources</span>, underinsurance, and lack of culturally competent care. Our actions will improve <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> to behavioral health care coverage and ensure that prevention and treatment are <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">accessible</span> and meet the needs of all populations. Advancing Clinical Innovation: To increase our understanding of what treatments are most effective for which populations, we need to increase the diversity of our research and clinical trials to inform that science. Our actions will engage a more diverse set of populations in informing our efforts and participating in clinical research so that we can innovate to improve health and well - being outcomes. </p></article>

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has approved 42 states, DC and the Virgin Islands to provide 12 months of continuous postpartum coverage through Medicaid and CHIP (as of December 2023). An estimated 540,000 Americans annually are eligible for essential care for a full year after pregnancy. HHS secured this option for states permanently in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 and CMS will continue to work with states on continuous coverage. CMS established a " " Birthing Friendly " " hospital designation - a publicly - reported, public - facing hospital designation on the quality and safety of maternity care (to be launched Fall 2023).

<p>SAMHSA and the White House Initiative on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders (AANHPI) convened a Summit on AANHPI Mental Health in July 2023. Four key issues emerged: Anti - AANHPI Hate, Language Justice, Behavioral Health Workforce, and Engaging with 988. Partners in this meeting made commitments to these Action Plans. SAMHSA hosted a follow - up working meeting of AANHPI leaders from communities, advocates, practitioners, researchers, national organizations, foundations, technology companies, and federal partners to develop action plans on the four themes. SAMHSA sponsored a Behavioral Health Equity Challenge focused on innovative outreach and engagement strategies that connect communities to behavioral health services in underserved communities. From 426 entries, ten community - based organizations were selected as winners of the challenge in August 2023. These winners presented and documented the impact of their innovative strategies in mental health, substance use prevention, and substance use treatment across historically underserved communities. Recognition will be given to these winners through various presentations and showcases sponsored by SAMHSA. SAMHSA hosted a <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">Policy</span> Academy on Black Youth Suicide to develop a strategic plan to address high rates of suicide among Black youth. Teams from 8 states (GA, IN, KY, LA, MD, OH, OR, PA) convened to address their specific state's needs, work with experts in suicide prevention, and develop <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">policy</span> strategies to take back to their states. They will continue to receive technical assistance sponsored by SAMHSA and report back. Since 2022, Secretary Becerra and HHS leaders have been traveling across the country to hear directly from Americans about the mental health challenges they're facing and engage with local leaders to strengthen the mental health and crisis care system in our communities. </p></article>

<p>Racial and ethnic minority populations, AI / ANs, older adults, women, pregnant and lactating individuals, LGBTQI + adults and youth, and persons with disabilities continue to be underrepresented in clinical trials, stifling health care innovation, and hindering the generalizability of effective treatments. Lack of diversity in clinical research has the potential to hinder innovation. Including populations that have been underrepresented in clinical trials and medical studies can help researchers better understand variation in the safety and effectiveness of interventions, identify new biological processes, and lead to new discoveries that can benefit other populations. 55 Evidence from clinical studies help inform health recommendations, insurance coverage, and reimbursement of healthcare services. Without representation of specific groups in trials and studies, we may lack confidence about how new therapeutics will impact all populations. A lack of representation in clinical studies can impede <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> to effective medical interventions for underrepresented groups if they are not included to build the evidence base to begin with. 56 56 Additional barriers contributing to underrepresentation of racial and ethnic minority patients ' participation in clinical trials include mistrust or fear and stigma of participation, lack of comfort with the clinical trial <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">process</span>, lack of information about clinical trials, time and resource constraints associated with clinical trial participation, and lack of clinical trial awareness. 57 </p></article>

<p>HUD works with Continuums of Care (CoC) nationally that prepare community plans to organize and deliver housing and services to meet the specific needs of people who are homeless as they move to stable housing and maximum self - sufficiency. As part of our equity focus, SNAPS conducted its second Coordinated Entry Equity Demonstration, deploying teams of technical assistance coaches to 15 Continuums of Care covering a broad range of communities. The goal of the demonstration was to design a more equitable assessment and prioritization <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">process</span> to improve conditions and outcomes for all Black and Brown people. The technical assistance coaching teams included providers with experience in racial equity and housing justice work, coordinated entry design, lived experience of homelessness, and navigating homeless systems and other related disciplines. In partnership with Black and Brown people as well as people with lived expertise of homelessness, CoCs identified system disparities through analyzing local data, agreed upon focus areas, and tested racially equitable coordinated entry system processes in service of significantly transforming the experience and housing stability of those disproportionately represented in local homeless responsive systems. HUD will publish guidance documents created from the learnings in the second demonstration on the HUD Exchange Homelessness Assistance website, and SNAPS will share a synopsis of the findings from the prior two cohorts to scale future improvements and interventions nationally. </p></article>

<p>Under the Biden - Harris Administration, HUD's work to advance equity has aligned with the following strategic goals: promoting equitable development and increasing the supply of affordable housing; advancing sustainable homeownership and wealth generation; reducing barriers and enhancing support for protected classes of people by enforcing fair housing regulations, advancing housing justice, and improving rental assistance.; reducing racial and ethnic disparities in homeless systems through identifying and addressing barriers; and advancing sustainable communities by strengthening climate resilience and energy efficiency, promoting environmental justice, and driving the creation of good - paying jobs. In advancement of our goal to promote equitable development, we have released <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">funding</span> to ensure communities can pair housing investments with infrastructure projects; strengthened our nation - to - nation relationships with Tribal Leaders on housing; conducted research on the impacts of zoning laws; and launched initiatives to bridge the racial wealth gap. </p></article>

<p>COVID - 19 had a negative impact on many businesses resulting in the laying off or reduced work hours for many FHA - insured borrowers. As the reduced income directly impacted a borrower's ability to make their mortgage payments, many fell behind in their payments and needed a loan modification or some other type of loss mitigation action. As the economic impacts of COVID - 19 affected Black and Brown people the most, per a Forbes article referencing a survey, about one third of Latino households are facing serious problems paying their mortgage or rent, and nearly 30 % of Black households and a quarter of Native American households reported the same difficulties. SFH lowered costs for borrowers by reducing its Annual Mortgage Insurance Premium (MIP) Rates and established a 40 - Year Loan modification to better assist struggling homeowners from losing their assets to foreclosure, particularly Black and Brown households. This action supports the Biden - Harris Administration's goals of making homeownership more <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">accessible</span> and affordable for the nation's working families, particularly Black and Brown households for whom FHA - insured mortgages have been a cornerstone for <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> to homeownership. This action will help address historic disparities in homeownership, where Black and Brown homebuyers have been underrepresented. The nation's homebuyers will see immediate savings through FHA's mortgage insurance premium reductions, particularly Black and Brown borrowers who often rely on FHA - insured mortgages to attain homeownership. </p></article>

Specifically, in FY 2022, FHEO issued a memorandum titled, " " Implementation of the Office of General Counsel's Guidance on Application of Fair Housing Act Standards to the Use of Criminal Records by Providers of Housing and Real Estate - Related Transactions. " " This memorandum supports the Administration's commitment to protect tenant rights and reviewed fair housing <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">principles</span> related to the use of criminal records, highlighted the need for FHEO investigators, Fair Housing Initiatives Program grantees (FHIPs), and Fair Housing Assistance Program agencies (FHAPs) to be aware of the ways in which criminal background screening policies and practices can violate the Fair Housing Act, provided tips for conducting investigations relating to criminal background screening, and set out best practices related to the use of criminal background screening information on applicants or tenants. The issuance of this memo has been followed by the signing of Voluntary Compliance Agreements that serve as an example for requiring more inclusive tenant screening policies by housing providers. In October 2023, HUD published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would eliminate the agency's restrictions on the use of fair housing testers with prior felony convictions or certain other convictions by Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) grantees and Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP) agencies. Fair housing testers provide invaluable support to HUD and HUD's fair housing partners by taking part in housing transactions to screen for discrimination. </p></article>

As detailed within this Equity Action Plan, HUD will enact a dedicated training curriculum to national fair housing partners to ensure that knowledge of Fair Housing protections is widespread and actionable in local communities. Similarly, HUD will employ targeted efforts to engage with key populations, including those impacted by gender - based violence, LGBTQIA + communities, and people impacted by the criminal justice system, to improve the administration and delivery of HUD - assisted programs and services. Reduce racial and ethnic disparities in homeless systems through identifying and addressing barriers to engagement by underserved populations: Promoting equity is a key component in reducing homelessness. People experiencing homelessness are among the most underserved and overlooked - most especially Black, Hispanic, and Native American or Alaska Native people, who experienced increases in homelessness and are significantly overrepresented among this population. Through specialized research and data gathering initiatives, the Agency will continue to improve its ability to better identify, engage, and re - house Black, Brown, Indigenous and other systematically disadvantaged people experiencing unsheltered homelessness. In addition, HUD will expand its work with program and community partners to incorporate the voice and leadership of people with lived experience to create tailored, equitable solutions for individuals ' needs to accentuate a new approach to homelessness relief and further equal <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> to eviction protection <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">resources</span>.

<p>HUD's 2021 Annual Homeless Assessment Report finds that 10 percent of Black heads of households in poverty and 12 percent of Native American or Alaska Native households in poverty experienced sheltered homelessness at some point in 2021, compared to 3 percent of all households in poverty. That Black and Brown people experience homelessness at higher rates than white households is consistent with HUD's research on Worst Case Housing Needs, which finds that Black and Hispanic households are more likely to be very low - income, renters, and paying more than 50 percent of their income on rent than other groups. These statistics highly correlate with higher probably that someone will experience homelessness. Research suggests that Black and Brown households, particularly low - income renter households headed by Black women, experience evictions at disproportionately high rates. Evictions contribute to long - term housing instability and homelessness. Other factors contributing to disproportionate rates of homelessness among Black and Brown people, include criminal justice histories and discrimination from landlords and employers. In their report, Coordinated Entry Systems: Racial Equity Analysis, C4 Innovations found that race is a predictor of the score that individuals experiencing homelessness receive on commonly used vulnerability assessment tools meant to help homeless services providers prioritize housing <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">resources</span>. For example, the study finds that non - White individuals were 32 percent less likely than White individuals to receive a high prioritization score, meaning that non - White individuals may be less likely to be prioritized for permanent supportive housing or Housing First. An eight - city study of structural racism and homelessness conducted in 2016 found that race was a predictor of the likelihood of returning to a homeless situation after leaving a shelter or other program. They found that Black young adults were 69 percent more likely to exit back into homelessness than their white counterparts, and Native and Asian young </p></article>

<p>Between 2019 and 2021, the prevalence of worst case housing needs among very low - income renters increased by 3.2 percentage points for non - Hispanic Black households and by 2.3 points for Hispanic households, compared to an increase of 0.4 points for non - Hispanic White households. Research into the cause of the affordable housing shortage finds that the biggest impediment to building more affordable housing is the availability and cost of land; thus addressing the costs and constraints of developing land is a key step to improving equity. Restrictive land use and zoning laws are major drivers of the national housing shortage preventing development of moderately priced housing stock and driving up prices and rents. Land use and zoning restrictions also have long been used to reinforce racial, ethnic, and class - based segregation. As costs increase and housing options narrow, Black and Brown households experience longer commutes, less <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> to <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">resources</span> and opportunities, and greater housing instability.

<p>A large body of literature has investigated the relationship between environmental toxins, race, and poverty. Most notably, the 1987 landmark study by Robert Bullard " " Toxic Waste and Race in the United States " " that demonstrated a correlation between the placement of toxic waste facilities and low - income Black and Brown communities Since then, several studies from interdisciplinary approaches continue to asses environmental injustices as demonstrated in Environmental Justice: The Economics of Race, Place, and Pollution or seen in the legacies from redlining and pollution. Researcher Diana Hernandez demonstrates in two papers how weatherization can be a catalyst for reducing the energy burden affecting low - income individuals and ultimately improve health and social outcomes among African Americans. Through the publications Climate Justice Starts at Home: Building Resilient Housing to Reduce Disparate Impacts From Climate Change in Residential Settings and Energy efficiency as energy justice: addressing racial inequities through investments in people and places she finds that Black households, even when disaggregating income, are more likely to live in less - efficient homes, demonstrating the legacy of housing segregation, redlining, and lack of equitable <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> to financing. These additional energy costs affect utility costs. She poses not just utility assistance but weatherization and green energy improvements as mechanisms to reducing environmental and economic injustices. To complement the body of literature on this topic, the White House Council on Environmental Quality developed the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST) using nationally consistent data and an approach that combines environmental and demographic indicators to identify historically disadvantaged communities through an interactive map. The tool measures burdens in eight categories: climate change, energy, health, housing, legacy pollution, transportation, water and wastewater, and workforce development. Individuals seeking careers in the green construction industry often face barriers in <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">accessing</span> training opportunities (including apprenticeships) to become certified and / or qualified for the employment opportunities.

The agenda aims to help HUD - assisted renters take critical steps toward financial well - being and potential homeownership through saving, credit building, and banking. In July 2023, HUD released a Notice of <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">Funding</span> Opportunity (NOFO) for $ 126 million for the Family Self - Sufficiency (FSS) program to help HUD - assisted families increase earned income and improve their financial stability. The FSS Program advances equity in the rental assistance portfolio by utilizing HUD - assisted housing as a platform to improve the lives of residents. Black and Brown peopleare overrepresented in HUD - assisted housing, and the majority of FSS participants are Black, Latino, and Asian. FSS provides a critical link between HUD - assisted residents and community partners who enhance the quality of life of residents with childcare, transportation, basic adult education, job training, employment counseling, substance / alcohol abuse treatment, financial empowerment, asset building skills, and homeownership counseling. This <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">funding</span> opportunity allows for the Agency to seek new FSS programs for residents in public, voucher, and multifamily housing, by adding additional grant opportunities a greater number of HUD - assisted residents will have an opportunity to build assets, which may lead to homeownership. New FSS awards will be announced in early 2024. </p></article>

<p>To facilitate FHA financing for borrowers in search of achieving homeownership for the first time, FHA has issued multiple <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">policy</span> changes. These policies include: Calculating Effective Income After a Reduction or Loss of Income for Borrowers Affected by Presidentially Declared COVID - 19 National Emergency ML 2022 - 09 Consideration of Positive Rental Payment History for First Time Homebuyers in Forward Mortgage Purchase Transactions ML 2022 - 17 Revisions to Rental Income Policies, Property Eligibility, and Appraisal Protocols for <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">Accessory</span> Dwelling Units ML 2023 - 17 HUD awarded $ 5.5 million in grants to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and $ 10.5 million in grant awards to four Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) to establish research Centers of Excellence (COEs) to conduct housing and community development research. The awarded COEs will conduct innovative research addressing housing, economic development, and the built environment in underserved communities. HUD's Office of Housing Counseling has launched an initiative focused on building direct relationships with HBCUs and their surrounding communities to increase knowledge of housing counseling services and affordable housing programs. This effort is part of a larger ongoing initiative to grow partnerships with HBCUs and other Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) to train the next generation of housing counselors and to empower the next generation of homeowners. The type of activities that will take place through this initiative include: education workshops to inform students on the potential impact of student loans on future housing choices and opportunities; counseling and education, including ways to build credit, to increase homeownership rates of students, faculty, parents, and residents of the greater community; Counseling and education to students, instilling an understanding of the responsibilities of tenancy in off - campus rental housing and internships and training for students to become housing counselors. HUD continues to break barriers as part of HUD's leadership of PAVE to address housing - related barriers to wealth generation. Specifically, the interagency initiative continues to combat bias in home appraisals. FHA is now contributing its appraisal data to FHFA's Federal Shared Appraisal Database, the nation's first publicly available datasets of aggregate statistics on appraisal records. FHA is also working to ensure that any borrower who suspects they have been a potential victim of appraisal bias be informed of their options, including the right to request a Reconsideration of a Value (ROV) on the appraisal. Through HUD's new partnership with the National Association of Real Estate Brokers (NAREB), the Agency will work to increase education and outreach, and take a bold step toward remedying appraisal discrimination, closing the wealth gap, and advancing racial equity. As a result of interactive consultation and multiple listening sessions which serve to strengthen the nation - to - nation relationship between HUD and Tribal communities, HUD's Office of Housing Counseling is working to expand <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> to homeownership by increasing the number of certified housing counselors serving Tribal communities.

Further, NASA analyzed proposal submission data from calendar years (CY) 2020 and 2021 to support the feedback received from the June 2021 RFI. NASA found that proposals submitted by organizations from underserved communities represented 13 percent in CY 2020, and 11 percent in CY 2021. NASA determined that these figures demonstrated the reported lack of awareness of NASA programs. In July 2023, NASA issued a second public RFI for feedback on barriers for entities that have engaged with and / or applied but are not yet recipients of NASA awards.

<p>NSF's Create Opportunities Everywhere (COE) is a comprehensive approach for inspiring, attracting, supporting, and advancing groups underrepresented in STEM. This strategy incorporates all NSF directorates and offices and encourages increased investment and advocacy for equity in program delivery while building on the concept of the " " Missing Millions. " " The National Science Board (NSB) conceptualizes the Missing Millions as the difference between the demographics of the research community and the Nation's demographics. The NSB has charged NSF with reducing this talent gap. Through COE, NSF will accelerate equitable <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> to NSF's research <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">funding</span>, foster collaborations and partnerships with educational institutions serving underrepresented groups, and support developing a diverse STEM education and workforce enterprise.

These discussions have yielded critical insights into how NSF can better support the inclusion of underrepresented scientists by emphasizing the importance of more general impact statements in grant applications, ensuring diversity within review panels, and increasing participation of researchers from Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). Under the June 2022 Executive Order 14075, Advancing Equality for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex (LGBTQI +) Individuals, the Office of the Chief Statistician of the United States provided recommendations for Federal agencies on best practices to collect self - reported sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data in federal statistical surveys. In an effort led by the CDIO, a dedicated team of individuals across the agency has developed a pilot survey to collect voluntary, non - personally identifiable SOGI data from within the NSF workforce. These efforts are taking place in concert with the National Council of Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) efforts to pilot the collection of SOGI data in their national surveys. D. Advancing Equity Through Key Legislation: NSF is committed to the principle that a diverse scientific workforce is vital to promoting advances in knowledge, innovation, and the global competitiveness of the U.S. scientific enterprise. Under the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, NSF appointed its first CDIO in December. The office of the CDIO is responsible for guiding and leading the Foundation's strategic plans to promote diversity, equity, inclusion, and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> (DEIA) in all NSF - funded activities. In addition to advocating for DEIA within the Foundation's workforce and funded programs, the CDIO is partnering with other agencies and thought leaders to advance the mission of broadening participation in the U.S. science and technology enterprise. The CDIO is guided by the principle that diversity, in all forms, enriches the scientific community, drives breakthroughs, and brings forth lasting solutions to urgent problems. </p></article>

<p>All agencies and entities that make up a Federal agency have responsibilities under the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued Management Directive 715 (MD - 715).

<p>In analysis of the Current Population Survey, the Kaiser Family Foundation reports that those enrolled in employer - based health insurance with incomes at or below 199 % of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) pay an average of 10.4 % of their family income on health insurance premiums and out - of - pocket costs compared to an overall average of four percent for all employer - based enrollees. Health care premiums as a percentage of Federal pay have outpaced wage increases; for example, in 2012, a self only premium in the most popular nationwide plan represented 4.8 % of a GS - 5, Step 5 salary; in 2016, that figure rose to 5.6 %; and, in 2022, it is 5.9 %. Those that fall in the 200 % to 399 % FPL range pay 6.9 % of family income for health insurance premiums and out - of - pocket costs.

<p>Since its founding, SBA has delivered millions of loans, loan guarantees, contracts, counseling sessions, and other forms of assistance to small businesses and innovative startups. Many of these businesses are owned by entrepreneurs who identify with communities that have been traditionally underserved and where federal policies have historically impeded equal opportunity.

<p>SBA's regular engagement with the small business community and its stakeholders helped inform the Equity Action Plan. Through its nationwide network of field and program offices, SBA communicates directly with entrepreneurs via activities such as: training events, small business coaching sessions, office hour calls, and the <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">regulation</span> and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">policy</span> notification <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">process</span>. SBA also gains insights from Resource Partners, small business trade associations, chambers of commerce and other entities similarly focused on aiding small business growth. SBA's Council on Underserved Communities (CUC) continues to consult directly with the Administrator and SBA executive leaders. The collaboration and input from all these sources are invaluable as SBA continues to formulate meaningful, equity - conscious policies, practices, and strategies that can create opportunities for underserved firms. </p></article>

Consolidated buying practices - purchasing services or products in bulk from one or more suppliers to maximize efficiencies - reduce opportunities for small vendors, including SDBs, to compete for contracts. Contract bundling, a subset of consolidation, takes procurements previously dedicated to small businesses and transforms them into larger, more complex purchases that either expressly or practically exclude small firms. Given that the federal government has an overall 23 percent target goal for small business and socio - economic prime contracting and subcontracting participation, there is a challenge to find the right balance between efficiency and equity program objectives in federal <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">procurement</span> when considering how federal dollars are allocated. 15 An increased focus on efficiency via bundling leads to a reduction in the <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">allocation</span> of federal dollars to small firms and, ultimately, underserved communities. </p></article>

<p>1. Advance education programs and outreach to SDBs and small businesses in underserved communities through updates to the 7 (j) grant program. SBA will be able to target SDBs in the underserved communities and improve education and support of staff at SBA field offices and Resource Partners. This update to the grant program secures nationwide technical assistance, designed to provide one - on - one needs - based training and counseling to firms in these communities. These tailored services aim to elevate firms ' capabilities and readiness to improve their operations and sustainability in the federal marketplace. Further, SBA field offices and Resource Partners will provide a clear understanding to potential applicants of how to properly obtain and use the SBA certification set - aside programs (Women Owned Small Business (WOSB), 8 (a), HUBZone, and Veterans Certification). Achieving a better understanding of the various set - aside programs supports the development of a contract - ready pool of SDBs as potential contract awardees. 2.

SBA leaves the definition of " " underserved " " for the Reinvestor SBIC program intentionally broad, enabling fund managers to make the case for why the underlying small businesses and startups that receive the investment capital are underserved. 2.

<p>Barriers to Equity: Incomplete demographic data in our records can hamper our ability to determine whether our programs are equitably serving our applicants and beneficiaries. 34 In 1987, we started the Enumeration at Birth (EAB) <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">process</span> with States as an efficient way for parents to obtain an SSN for a newborn during the birth registration <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">process</span>. This convenient option allows parents to obtain an SSN without having to visit a local Social Security field office or Card Center. However, unlike the standard SSN application, the current EAB <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">process</span> does not collect voluntarily race and ethnicity data. Today, almost all new SSNs are processed through EAB. In FY 2022, EAB accounted for 99 percent of SSNs issued for children under the age of one. The increase in assigning SSNs through EAB led to an unintended 30 plus year period of incomplete voluntary collection of race and ethnicity data in our records. 35 </p></article>

We are very proud to have achieved and exceeded our overall Small Business Goal along with three of the four socio - economic goals: Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Women Owned Small Business (WOSB), and Service - Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business. SSA has received an ' A ' on our scorecard every year since 2013. 2) In January 2023, we created a strategic outreach campaign using an agency - wide listserv of HBCUs, ISSCs, and professional organizations with diverse membership to encourage them to apply to our research <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">funding</span> opportunities. 3) In Spring 2023, we provided informational webinars to HBCUs and ISSCs about grants in advance of the Request for Application (RFA) publications. 4) In Summer 2023, we completed the Retirement and Disability Research Consortium (RDRC) recompetition for the five - year agreements (i.e., research grants) covering activities for FY 2024 - FY 2028. Six centers were selected to receive the awards. Five out of six centers include HBCUs or ISSCs as partners, with HBCU and ISSC staff leading the centers as directors or co - directors. 5) In September 2023, our OT participated in the " " The Future of Cyber Resilience - How HBCUs Can Change the Game " " panel.

These engagements created opportunities to build partnerships with community organizations and to offer support to claimants seeking retirement, disability, and survivor benefits. 2) Received feedback from Tribal communities on recommendations for locations to implement video equipment to bridge the distance between their Tribal communities and field offices. 3) Implemented a pilot program in which SSA employees were flown to three remote communities in Alaska and provided services to community members at local health facilities. 4) Received valuable feedback from Tribal Nations and Urban Indian Organizations highlighting a barrier to services and a business need for SSA to provide training support to new Tribal Benefit Coordinators working in Urban Indian Centers and Indian Health Services in underserved communities. These Coordinators, who are not SSA employees, require programmatic <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">policy</span> training to provide awareness of eligibility to our programs and support to Tribal members by accompanying them to field office appointments. 5) Actively supported the OMB Workgroup to finalize deliverables for the Native Language Memorandum of Agreement with 24 Federal agencies, a 10 - year action plan supporting an All of Government approach, scheduled for release in November 2023. </p></article>

Complete our regulatory agenda 18 to simplify SSI, particularly our In - Kind Support and Maintenance (ISM) policies. Under current <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">policy</span>, ISM refers to reported or estimated assistance with food and / or shelter provided to SSI claimants from others within or outside their households. We determine claimants ' eligibility for and amount of SSI payments, partially based on the amount of ISM they receive. Simplifying ISM policies will make the SSI program easier for the public to understand and less burdensome for us to administer, and reduce the potential for improper payments. Omitting Food from ISM Calculation: Removes food from the calculation of ISM. Food assistance received from others will no longer impact claimants ' benefit eligibility and amount. (NPRM. Feb. 15, 2023. 88 FR 9779.) Expansion of the Rental Subsidy <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">Policy</span> for SSI Applicants and Recipients: Expands rental subsidy exemption currently applicable in seven States nationwide, exempting claimants from ISM from other household members if they pay at least one third of the SSI benefit on rent. (NPRM. Aug. 24, 2023. 88 FR 57910.) Expand the Definition of a Public Assistance (PA) Household: Adds Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to the list of means - tested programs included in our definition of PA households; if every household member receives at least one of the specified types of assistance, we would not reduce SSI benefits due to ISM or deeming from other household members.

In August 2023, the Annual Statistical Supplement included updated sets of the 12 tables analyzing payments by race and ethnicity in the body of the publication under Summary 5. A Expanded by Race. We also published Modeling Income in the Near Term (MINT) projections, MINT fact sheets, and Retirement and Disability Research Consortium working papers, providing updated projections, including by race and ethnicity, to inform agency and academic research. 2) In August 2022, we added race and ethnicity questions to the online SSN application <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">process</span> (OSSNAP) used to obtain an SSN card, resulting in an increase, from August 2022 to August 2023, for voluntary reporting of race information from 46 percent to 52 percent, and of ethnicity information from 54 percent to 59 percent. 3) In FY 2023, we created the Race and Ethnicity Voluntary Reporting Tracking Dashboard to inform our collection strategies. 4) In June 2023, we provided public information materials in English and Spanish to encourage voluntary reporting of race and ethnicity data during new and replacement SSN card applications in select Social Security Administration (SSA) field offices. 5) In August 2023, we made form SS - 5 (Application for a Social Security Card) instructions available in 15 languages other than English and Spanish in local SSA field offices and Card Centers. The non - English instructions will help applicants with LEP complete the English - language form SS - 5. 6) In September 2023, we added race and ethnicity questions to the internet SSN replacement application <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">process</span> (iSSNRC) used to obtain a replacement SSN card through the my Social Security (mySSA) portal. </p></article>

<p>For FYs 2018 through 2022, we received over 4.5 million requests through the Telephone Interpreter Services (TIS) for 194 languages. During that time, about 80 percent of the language requests were for Spanish, Vietnamese, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Russian. For FYs 2018 through 2022, there were 20 languages that were often requested through our TIS that we were not able to provide. Nearly one in four American Indians and Alaska Natives have LEP or speak a language other than English at home. 19 For FYs 2018 through 2022, we received more requests for Navajo language than for German language assistance through the TIS. While two of our offices near the Navajo Reservation have employees who are proficient in Navajo language, we need TIS to provide service outside of this area. Through our Office of Native American Partnerships, we receive ongoing feedback from advocates in Tribal communities. Their recommendations to overcome complex applications and language barriers include: Assistance from Tribal Benefit Coordinators who understand the native language sufficiently to assist applicants. Assistance from a member from the Tribe, who understands the native language and Tribal health documentation sufficiently, in the absence of an Indian Health Service Coordinator to assist applicants. Outreach to inform Alaskan applicants that interpreter services may help them overcome barriers and improve application outcomes. This recommendation is based on research provided during the White House 10th Annual Native Language Summit in Albuquerque, NM. Through our LEP Steering Committee, we receive ongoing feedback and recommendations from advocates about ways to improve language <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span>, analyze these recommendations, and take appropriate action, such as, reminding employees on how to use the TIS.

<p>In initial claim situations, underpayments stem from benefits that are due back to the date of onset2 ², the first day a claimant meets the definition of disability or statutory blindness. Once an initial claim is approved, the person receiving SSI is paid back to the date of their application or the date of onset if they meet the definition of disability or statutory blindness after they submit their application. These past - due benefits are considered underpayments and may be subject to installments. In post - entitlement situations, underpayments are generally the result of reporting delays. For example, people receiving SSI payments are required to timely report any changes in their medical or non - medical (i.e., income, <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">resources</span>, or living arrangements) circumstances that may impact their payments. When a person receiving SSI payments does not timely report changes that will affect their payment amount, the field office will update the record noting a discrepancy, which may cause an underpayment. If an underpayment exceeds three times the Federal Benefit Rate, the payment due to the recipient is subject to installments. 23 </p></article>

<p>Disproportionately, White spouses with disabilities on average are more likely to receive survivor benefits compared to other racial groups, according to our data. 29, 30 For people who have disabilities and lost a spouse to death, and receive survivors benefits, about 60 to 80 percent are White, nine to 25 percent are Black, 10 to 20 percent are Other, and less than 10 percent are Unknown. We are working to understand the driving factors and how we can ensure equitable <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> to our programs. There are approximately 980,000 same - sex couple households in the United States. 31 We are conducting proactive outreach to help same - sex couples that were previously denied spousal survivor benefits. At the beginning of the pandemic, Black, Latino, and American Indian and Alaska Native people were disproportionately represented in COVID 19 - asssociated deaths. 32 For example, in the summer of 2021, the CDC found that American Indian and Alaska Native people died from COVID - 19 at a rate 2.8 times higher than same - age White people. 33 </p></article>

<p>The cornerstone of equity in foreign <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">policy</span> is direct action through the Department's Equity Principals who traveled the world to listen to and amplify the voices of marginalized populations. The Department produces numerous public reports that have strengthened their specific focus on equity, such as Human Rights Report, Trafficking in Persons Report, International Religious Freedom Report, and several equity - related Congressional reports. The Department also established its first Equity Agency Priority Goal (APG), outlined in the 2022 Plan, to advance equity in U.S. foreign policies, programs, and processes. As an example of how the APG drove significant organizational change by identifying outcomes and measuring results, the United States negotiated more than 50 United Nations outcome and / or consensus documents that expanded inclusive language of historically marginalized and underserved groups. This included United Nations General Assembly resolutions on the rights of Indigenous peoples, people of African descent, and eliminating gender - based violence. </p></article>

<p>The implementation of equity and inclusion into foreign assistance programs, <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">policy</span>, and practice is being led by the Office of Foreign Assistance, in coordination with the Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, and key bureaus and offices across the Department. Chief to this effort is global tracking of Department and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) foreign assistance programs addressing the specific needs of marginalized racial, ethnic, and other underserved communities. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2022, planned foreign assistance investments totaled $ 56.8 million, spread across all geographic regions. This complements existing tracking of programs and planned investments for other marginalized populations, such as Indigenous groups, LGBTQI + communities, women and girls, persons with disabilities, children in adversity, young and emerging leaders, and religious minorities. Additionally, the Department is creating a Social Inclusion Analysis Tool outlined in the 2022 Plan to help Department officials integrate and operationalize equity and inclusion into externally - facing foreign affairs areas: foreign <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">policy</span> implementation, foreign assistance program design, and diplomatic statecraft.

Institutional barriers from rules, restrictions, requirements, routines, traditions, or habits within society that are seamlessly integrated into education, workplace, relational, and other subcultures are often unnoticed inhibitors to equity for persons with disabilities.

<p>When President Biden took office in January 2021, the COVID - 19 pandemic was causing immense economic hardship in communities across the country, particularly for women, rural communities, and communities of color. On March 11, 2021, the President signed the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act of 2021 (H.R. 1319) into <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">law</span> to help communities recover and put our economy back on the path to stable growth. The ARP tasked the Treasury Department with implementing major initiatives, such as the Child Tax Credit, Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program, State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF), Capital Projects Fund (CPF), and Homeowner Assistance Fund. These initiatives have delivered much needed <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">resources</span> to vulnerable families and historically marginalized communities, including those in rural areas, Tribal communities, communities of color, and children living in poverty. </p></article>

<p>These are meaningful milestones that demonstrate Treasury's commitment to bolstering economic opportunity across the country. Our economic recovery from the pandemic was just the beginning of this work. Treasury is now deeply engaged in efforts to foster inclusive, equitable growth through government investments that unleash the economic potential of historically marginalized and under - resourced people and places. For instance, Treasury is delivering on President Biden's goal of closing the digital divide. In the rural South and dense urban areas alike, Black Americans are about twice as likely as their white counterparts to lack high - speed internet <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span>. Treasury has awarded over $ 8 billion for broadband projects to connect millions of Americans across the country to high - speed internet.

For example, the investment tax credit for solar and wind projects includes a substantial bonus for facilities built in low - income communities. According to outside estimates, the IRA will support new clean energy jobs, as well as incentivize the use of registered apprenticeships and the payment of prevailing wages to strengthen America's energy and economic security.

Businesses often need financial documentation, a business plan, accounting capacity, or a legal structure to apply for and receive commercial loans. These requirements are often beyond the capacity of underserved small businesses. Underserved communities lack financing for neighborhood essentials, such as schools, childcare, housing, and health - care clinics. As noted by the Urban Institute, CDFIs struggle to meet all needs for community development. While they can support some development needs, they look for additional <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">resources</span> to support the overall community ecosystem. CDFIs and MDIs that serve under - resourced stakeholders lack <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> to flexible capital to pass along to the communities they serve to not only help businesses grow but to also provide much needed services to their communities.

While growth can sometimes help with efficiency, some CDFIs note those efficiencies don't always come with that growth.

In recognition of the sovereignty of, and our partnership with, Tribal Nations, Treasury's Office of Tribal and Native Affairs is responsible for advising on departmental issues related to Tribal governments and Native communities, including the administration of $ 30 billion in direct Tribal set - asides to the benefit of over 2.5 million Tribal citizens. The Office also conducts consultations with Tribes and coordinates outreach. As of June 2023, the Office has hosted over 45 formal consultations and 700 Tribal engagement sessions. Treasury has made significant efforts to engage with stakeholders and the public on topics related to equity. For instance, in December 2022, the Department held the first TACRE meeting, with subsequent meetings in March, June, and September 2023. Since their first convening, the Committee established cross - cutting <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">principles</span> and priorities and has submitted 13 recommendations to Treasury. Recommendations are currently under review and address issues such as data transparency, taxpayer <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> to Direct File, direct engagement with taxpayers who could benefit from tax credits and working with CDFIs to promote diversification through the certification and re - certification processes. The Department collaborated with 12 national Hispanic and Latino organizations to host the first Treasury Department summit on investing in the economic future of the Latino community in June 2023 to elevate challenges and opportunities facing that community. The Latino Economic Summit brought together nearly 100 leaders from the private, non - profit, and government sectors to identify opportunities to unleash the potential of the Latino community and the entire economy. Treasury's Office of Civil Rights and Equal Employment Opportunity (OCRE) continues to work with the White House to encourage the appointment of Latino staff and continues working with community lenders to unlock potential that had previously been sidelined. The result will be economic growth within the Latino community, as well as shared prosperity for everyone. Treasury launched a blog series detailing the origins of racial economic disparities and the implications for the national economy. OCRE has made significant efforts to increase civil rights compliance and equal opportunity throughout the Department with the implementation of a new external civil rights language <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> plan and complaint tracking system.

<p>Under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, Treasury supported the economic recovery for communities and individuals impacted by COVID - 19 through the ARP. For example, the Department and the CDFI Fund have deployed historic amounts of capital to CDFIs and MDIs - institutions that have a demonstrated track record of reaching financially underserved borrowers. In addition, through the ECIP, Treasury has made close to $ 8.4 billion in investments in 170 community financial institutions, in addition to over $ 1.73 billion in grants through the CDFI ERP, and a historic $ 226 million investment in 68 Puerto Rican cooperativas, or cooperative community financial institutions. New ECIP reporting data made available in October 2023, reflecting lending in the final six months of 2022, showed that ECIP lenders originated a total of approximately $ 26 billion in loans, of which approximately 75 % went to low - and moderate - income borrowers, borrowers in rural communities and other categories of qualified lending. Approximately one third of their total originations, $ 8.6 billion, were " " deep impact " " loans, made to the hardest - to - serve borrowers, including those that are low - income, residents on Tribal lands and in US Territories and owners of very small businesses. Treasury leveraged the ERA program to create the first - ever nationwide infrastructure to prevent eviction, with more than 12.3 million household payments to families at risk of eviction as of June 30, 2023. This program has been particularly effective at reaching low - income and / or traditionally underserved renters, including Black and women - headed households. By reimagining how the IRS serves families, the IRS delivered half of the expanded Child Tax Credit (CTC) via monthly payments from July to December 2021. Treasury also collaborated with Code for America, a non - governmental non - profit, to build a streamlined, mobile - friendly portal in English and Spanish to make it easier for families to <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> the expanded CTC. New Census data released in 2022 showed that the expanded CTC was the leading driver behind a 46 percent decline in child poverty in 2021 - cutting the annual child poverty rate to its lowest - ever recorded level including record lows in Black, Hispanic, Native American, Asian, and white child poverty. Additionally, the permanent lifting of restrictions that prevented some Puerto Rican families from receiving the CTC led to 200,000 more Puerto Rican families receiving the credit when they filed taxes in 2022 compared to the year prior. As of September 2023, Treasury has approved 54 out of 56 state and territory applications for SSBCI Capital Programs totaling over $ 8.2 billion in allocations, and has announced approvals of up to $ 73 million corresponding to applications representing 39 Tribes.

<p>Office of Tax Analysis study on Disparities in the Benefits of Tax Expenditures by Race and Ethnicity. While the IRS doesn't have <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> to race data, racial disparities in audit rates mean that Black taxpayers are audited at three to five times the rate of non - Black taxpayers. As described in a memo from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue Daniel Werfel to Senator Ronald Wyden, this disparate impact is believed to be driven by correspondence audits among taxpayers who claim the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Filing of tax returns accounts for 63 % of the annual federal paperwork burden, including costs for preparing tax returns, as well as filing through software or third - party preparers. Americans often miss out on tax credits for which they are eligible, such as the estimated 5 million individuals who miss out on the EITC, which is roughly 80 percent of those eligible. </p></article>

<p>multiple approaches are necessary to tackle a wider range of burdens that constrain the ability of many partners to work with USAID. Some of USAID's acquisition and assistance processes are cost - prohibitive and onerous, especially for organizations with limited operational capacity. These include small, new, and local non - profit and commercial organizations / firms. In the course of conducting focus group consultations with external stakeholders, a crucial insight emerged: numerous organizations including many servicing historically marginalized communities are grappling with constrained operating budgets. This financial limitation significantly hampers their ability to effectively engage with arduous and prolonged solicitations and <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">funding</span> opportunities. Many of these organizations are staffed by smaller teams, which poses a challenge when responding to these opportunities.

<p>As part of the agency's equity 2021 assessment in response to Executive Order 13985, qualitative and quantitative data was collected from internal and external stakeholders, agency policies, and Agency reports. Further, the first annual USAID Partnering Experience Survey was released in 2022 with the aim to better understand the challenges encountered by partners seeking to work with the agency. Insights from the agency's 2021 assessment, combined with feedback from the 2022 partner survey, highlighted how some of the USG's excessively burdensome <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">procurement</span> processes create barriers for small and historically underrepresented organizations, impeding their competitive pursuit of award opportunities. </p></article>

When additional functions like MEL are added to the Gender Advisors role, they report too broad a workload, which may limit their ability to effectively incorporate gender equality and inclusive development in programming. </p></article>

<p>a) 2022 Equity Action Plan Update (pursuant to EO 13985) Since the launch of WorkwithUSAID.gov in November 2021, USAID has approved more than 4,700 partner profiles in the platform's Partner Directory, and of those partners, more than 1,600 have completed the pre - engagement assessment. By registering in the Partner Directory and taking the Pre - Engagement Assessment, potential partners are able to increase the visibility of their work, connect with others in the development community, and assess whether or not they are ready to respond to a USAID solicitation. The team has translated the top 20 <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">resources</span> on the platform into French, Spanish, and Arabic for use in host countries where USAID works. These <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">resources</span> are helping to bridge the gap for local entities that are not fluent in English as USAID continues to develop additional documentation in foreign languages. USAID's Inclusive Development e - learning module is now mandatory for all of the workforce. As of June 2023, 86 percent (11,200 out of approximately 13,000) of USAID's workforce have received the training on Inclusive Development. USAID held three external and three internal consultations with stakeholders, delivered two informational webinars for USAID staff, held consultations with program participants across USAID Missions and briefed all Bureaus and Independent Offices (B / IOs) on the development of the ' Know Your Protections ' (KYP) document (formerly known as the ' Beneficiaries Bill of Rights ' - BBoR). This document aims to summarize and highlight existing protections for USAID program participants, making them <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">accessible</span> and easily understandable. The document has been revised and is currently undergoing clearance at the agency. USAID developed the Social, Economic, and Environmental Accountability Mechanism (SEE - AM), which advances program participant protections. The mechanism provides a channel for program participants and affected communities to inform the Agency of harm experienced in relation to USAID's programs and projects overseas. USAID secured program funds for and onboarded a full - time Accountability Mechanism Official to manage SEE - AM design and implementation, and coordination of complaints processing. USAID launched the updated Acquisition and Assistance (A & A) Strategy and Implementation Plan in FY 2023, incorporating DEIA <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">principles</span>, such as: USAID simplified and reduced its onerous pre - award risk survey for local organizations seeking USAID <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">funding</span>. Agency lowered the barrier to entry by promoting more opportunities where applicants submit an initial concept paper (about five pages) before they are invited to submit a full application (typically 30 pages or more). This makes the initial step less costly for applicants. Issued a Renewal Award Guide and Template to train A & A staff to use a mechanism that leverages practices from collaborating, learning and adapting, and responds to adjustments in dynamic operating environments. The Senior <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">Procurement</span> Executive (SPE) sent a notice to remind prime contractors about the requirement of reporting data against their small business subcontracting plan and to improve the accuracy of data they submit. </p></article>

<p>The Agency identified and created a cadre of training, tools, and <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">resources</span> to streamline proposal and evaluation processes. M Bureau provides staff a platform to share innovative practices and systems to streamline <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">procurement</span> processes through the A & A Innovation Community of Practice. USAID updated its Youth <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">Policy</span> and released the new Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">Policy</span> in March 2023. USAID released its new LGBTQI + Inclusive Development <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">Policy</span> in August 2023 and Strategic Religious Engagement <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">Policy</span> in September 2023. These policies reiterate the importance of and clarify approaches to inclusion and equity in USAID's programs, for USAID staff and stakeholders. USAID recently announced the launch of the Racial and Ethnic Equity Initiative, and teams are conducting assessments and collecting data from USAID Missions overseas to build a knowledge base of operational practices and best practices that have successfully advanced social inclusion and racial equity in foreign assistance programming. Exposure to these best practices and technical guidance will encourage the adoption of quality equity programs on a broader scale. USAID Missions and Bureaus are now required to report on a new key issue narrative in their annual reports capturing racial and ethnic equity. They also must annually report on the percentage of completed evaluations with at least one local expert on the evaluation team. USAID released the Agency's highest level <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">policy</span> document, the <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">Policy</span> Framework, in March 2023. The <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">Policy</span> Framework emphasizes a commitment to embed DEIA <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">principles</span> across our programs, people, processes, policies, and practices so that development gains are more locally - led and benefit people of all backgrounds and identities. b) Environmental Justice Scorecard (pursuant to section 223 of EO 14008) USAID is not required to complete the Environmental Justice Scorecard. USAID promotes environmental equity and monitors progress through the Global Action for Climate Equity. c) Additional Efforts to Advance Equity Fourteen country - level Inclusive Development Assessments (IDAs), which aim to map the context and needs of marginalized groups through an intersectional lens to improve equity in programming, have been performed across the Agency. The ID Hub's Inclusive Development Activity for Mission Support (IDAMS) has begun work on three additional IDAs and is poised to to scale up these activities in FY 2024. The Office of Civil Rights established the External Civil Rights Division covering Title VI and other relevant civil rights authorities to ensure USAID complies with Title VI requirements under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Division receives and addresses complaints of discrimination in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance The External Civil Rights Division's internal website launched in June 2023, which educates USAID staff on the Title VI legal requirements and statutes and how they apply to USAID programs and partners. In addition to the significant progress made in awarding more funds directly to local entities - which, in FY2022 reached the highest level ($ 1.6 billion) and percent (10.2 percent) in over a decade - USAID has developed a new method to track the extent to which the Agency's programming is locally led.

<p>June 2023, USDA announced a $ 262.5 million investment to support 33 projects, across U.S. institutions of higher education, designed to train the next generation of diverse agricultural professionals. The projects are led by 1890 land - grant institutions (historically Black land - grant universities), 1994 land - grant institutions (tribal colleges and universities), Alaska native - serving institutions and native Hawaiian - serving institutions, Hispanic - serving institutions, and institutions of higher education located in the Insular Areas. Most projects involve collaboration with other minority - serving institutions and a myriad of other partners, including other academic institutions, non - profit and private - sector organizations, and state and USDA agencies. Resourced by the ARPA, as amended by the IRA, the From Learning to Leading: Cultivating the Next Generation of Diverse Food and Agriculture Professionals (NextGen) Program is enabling minority - serving institutions to engage, recruit, retain, train, and support students to build and sustain the next generation of the food, agriculture, natural <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">resources</span>, and human sciences workforce, including the future USDA workforce. It is administered by NIFA, which is also partnering with The Extension Foundation to increase the capacity of the funded institutions. The Extension Foundation will provide free grant proposal development as well as technical assistance to all grantees to support project management. Additionally, NIFA is working with the Intercultural Development Research Association (IDRA) to determine the overall effectiveness of the NextGen program; IDRA will track program outcomes, report impact, and evaluate individual and program - wide activities. This historic investment will provide training and support to more than 20,000 future food and agricultural leaders through 33 projects executed by more than 60 institutions across 24 U.S. states and Insular Areas. </p></article>

<p>Barriers to Equity: A complex web of factors causes food insecurity and contributes to diet - related diseases and health disparities.

A key barrier to healthy eating is lack of <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> to nutritious food. The food environment (e.g., proximity to stores, food prices, available food options) influences a person's food choices and diet quality. Disparities in food insecurity and diet - related diseases exist partly because of persistent structural inequities, such as lack of <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> to health care, safe housing, and transportation. </p></article>

<p>Evidence Base to Support Strategy: USDA has received comprehensive feedback from small and disadvantaged businesses. For example, the Forecast of Business Opportunities tool and the Path to Prosperity program respond to a series of listening sessions with hundreds of small - disadvantaged businesses nationwide. There were three key takeaways from this listening: (1) small disadvantaged businesses who have not previously done business with the government, find many of the processes hard to understand and intimidating; (2) small disadvantaged businesses need more time to prepare for upcoming contracting opportunities and (3) for new entrants in particular, they do not know where to start or how to take full advantage of all of government <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">resources</span>.

For example: Tribal corporations are currently ineligible for RD programs.

And tribal commercial activity is deemed disqualifying for some RD programs, even though - because they lack a robust tax base - tribal nations often systematically participate in commercial markets to accrue revenue necessary to provide their nation, and often neighboring communities, with (public) goods and services.

Feedback included the annual USDA - wide Tribal Consultation on Equity and Barriers, most recently in May 2023. Tribal leaders identified the needs and barriers - confirmed upon internal review and by external evidence - listed above. Actions also rest on program data and historical knowledge about discrimination and civil rights cases.

<p>At the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), we recognize that our pursuit of equity isn't just the right thing to do. Equity is essential for building our Nation's economy from the bottom up and the middle out. When we create opportunity for all - regardless of zip code or background - farmers, farmworkers, ranchers, landowners, communities, families, and business owners get <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> to the tools they need to thrive in the communities they love. On day one of the Biden - Harris Administration, President Biden issued Executive Order 13985, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government. The Executive Order recognized that although equal opportunity is a bedrock ideal of American democracy, it is too often thwarted by entrenched disparities in our laws, public policies, and institutional structures and processes. The Order kicked off an ambitious whole - of - government equity agenda, initiating a learning <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">process</span> in pursuit of a more perfect union. </p></article>

<p>Centering equity in everything we do is crucial to the future prosperity of children and families throughout the country and to rural and agricultural America. USDA's 2022 Equity Action Plan described a subset of the hundreds of actions we are taking, spotlighting those with high potential impact for underserved farmers and ranchers, families, children, and rural communities. This 2023 update builds on that strong foundation and follows the lead of President Biden's Executive Order 14091, which regularizes equity action planning and insists that federal agencies use all the <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">policy</span> levers we have to make progress. President Biden has emphasized that equity is a generational commitment, not a one - year project. I emphatically agree. Success depends on the institutionalization this year's plan reflects. At USDA, we have embedded equity in the work we do across the Department, and we are moving forward together, based on the insight that our country is stronger when everyone has a seat at the table and everyone has food on their plate. It is our moral imperative to do the challenging but achievable work of building a more inclusive future. Under this Administration, equity is more than a catchphrase. It's a promise. </p></article>

Specifically, the requirement for a separate application for coverage prior to the loss event was eliminated for anyone already certified as an underserved producer - that is, for beginning, veteran, limited resource, women, or minority farmers. This eliminated otherwise annual application requirements; participation instead requires only loss notifications and applications for payment. The result has been substantial growth in producer participation. </p></article>

<p>A. FSA will align farm credit and assistance with priorities and values. FSA will continue to modify and improve farm loan programs to further reduce application processing times and enhance customer experience, and will prioritize its County Committees as key contributors for outreach and mentorship. B. USDA will identify statutory barriers that prevent USDA from serving a broader set or producers or that disproportionately harm certain producers. Some hurdles and harmful policies - for example, the <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">allocation</span> of safety net programs by crop and historical plantings " " base acres " " or inflexible limits or life - time ineligibility for farm loans - are enshrined in statute and cannot be remedied through administrative action. As these barriers are identified, USDA will continue to explore opportunities to address them legislatively. Eight such legislative proposals were included for farm loans in the President's FY 2024 Budget. C. USDA will identify weaknesses in farm safety - net program design that may be contributing to inequitable support, and remove hurdles and tailor programs to all types of producers, production and business models. The Farm Production and Conservation mission area will improve Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP); Emergency Relief Program (ERP); Conservation Reserve Program (CRP); RMA products for specialty crops and value added producers; and RMA training and recruitment of crop insurance agents, adjusters, and outreach educators.

<p>D. USDA will create new, more, and better market opportunities for producers, which creates a fairer playing field for small - and mid - size farmers. USDA is investing in developing new market opportunities and fairer markets SO that producers have more power in the marketplace and greater opportunities to generate income and make a living in agriculture. Ongoing efforts involve investments in new market opportunities, amelioration of supply chain bottlenecks, and improvements in fair competition. E. USDA will expand reach to all producers by leveraging partnerships with trusted technical advisors. Across the Department - FSA, NRCS, RMA, NIFA, and the Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement (OPPE) - USDA will continue and expand grant and cooperative agreement programs that support delivery of conservation assistance, risk management education, farming and production - related education, and technical assistance to underserved farmers (including beginning, limited resource, socially disadvantaged, and veteran farmers). F. USDA will target direct assistance and technical support based on degree of need. USDA is implementing support for support for underserved producers; progressive payment factoring; and whole - farm revenue approaches particularly suited to smaller operations. Where USDA has discretion, as in the ad - hoc disaster programs, the Department has been pursuing these strategies administratively. Other permanent programs would need legislative action; USDA is providing technical assistance to Congress on these areas. G. USDA will institutionalize <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> for broader stakeholder viewpoints. USDA is making a concerted effort to bring new voices to the table and to expand its stakeholder base. To that end, a large group of both longstanding and new formal committees are providing valuable input, including: the USDA Equity Commission; NRCS state technical committees; FSA County Committees, including urban county committees; and other new and continuing Federal Advisory Committees (Urban Agriculture, Tribal, Minority Farmers, New and Beginning Farmers). </p></article>

<p>Veterans, their families, caregivers and survivors from historically underserved demographic groups are most likely to experience systemic barriers that negatively impact them in benefit outcomes and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> to VA services. Some areas of concern and identified barriers where VA will immediately focus are as follows: The lack of authoritative information sources and aggregate data pertaining to VBA benefit utilization by socio - demographic groups. On July 26, 2023, Government Accountability Office (GAO) released its report: VA Disability Benefits: Actions Needed to Further Examine Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Compensation (GAO - 23 - 106097) that recommended VA develop a documented detailed plan to address limitations related to its race and ethnicity data for Veterans. The lack of objectivity in potential areas of high risk in the adjudication and promulgation of disability compensation benefits, as shown through data that might be indicative of bias in the evidence - gathering <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">process</span> (i.e., diagnostic exams / mental health) and / or consistency of disability ratings evaluations.

<p>To address these barriers, VA will staff the newly established VBA Office of Equity Assurance to: Establish initiatives and track actions to ensure equity action plans and goals are achieved. Assess the impact of ethnicity, socio - economic status, rural location, gender identification, tribal or native American affiliation and era of military service, on women Veterans ' opportunity to <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> VA benefits. Review prior studies and reports that identify and explore gaps in and barriers to benefits for underrepresented groups as well as engage in new studies that further refine and identify gaps and barriers experienced by underrepresented groups. Review each VBA benefit program to determine if there are systemic issues that create disparities within underrepresented groups and - where disparities are found - work to eliminate them through specific action plans that could include improved policies, procedures, training, quality control, data, outreach, customer experience and outcomes. Develop a VBA data strategy that leads to programmatic action to improve disability benefit outcomes. Conduct a systemic data analysis using available socio - demographic data to assess VBA's benefit utilization populations, identify potential disparities and understand the root cause (s) of any identified disparities using demographic data approved by the Data Governance Council. Develop strategic partnerships with VA stakeholders to address matters of equity for members of underrepresented groups. </p></article>

Population health metrics (e.g., analyzing existing quality measures by demographic characteristics such as race / ethnicity using existing tools such as the Primary Care Equity Dashboard and the National Veteran Health Equity Report and manually looking for disparities on other clinical data platforms). For example, the National Veteran Health Equity Report provides information regarding disparities in patient experiences and health care quality for Veterans who obtain health care services through VHA. Data on disparities are presented by race / ethnicity, gender, age group, rurality of residence, socio - economic status and service - connected disability rating, and by cardiovascular risk factors of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes. VA leaders and staff can use these findings to inform and tailor quality improvement approaches for both Veteran patient experience and health care outcomes.

<p>OMB illustrates that VA contracting is increasingly dominated by established vendors rather than new entrants. As VA has reduced its total vendor base from 11,964 in FY 2020 to 10,887 in FY 2022, the share of established vendors (not recent or new entrants) has increased. In FY 2020, 61.7 % of VA's vendors were established vendors. In FY 2022, the share of established vendors increased to 66.6 %. This suggests the reduction in total vendors is occurring at the expense of new or recent entrants. An analysis of VA - funded contract actions from the Federal <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">Procurement</span> Data System demonstrates how the Veterans First <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">procurement</span> hierarchy reduces the number of contract opportunities for non - Veteran disadvantaged firms. In FY 2022, out of $ 6.3 billion in contract dollars awarded through some type of set - aside, VA awarded $ 5.7 billion (91 %) specifically using the SDVOSB set - aside. Since the SDVOSB set - aside is first on VA's <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">procurement</span> hierarchy, this result is predictable. However, the second tier on VA's <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">procurement</span> hierarchy (VOSB set - aside) was used to award only $ 59 million, a dramatically lower figure.

Alternatively, the last tier on VA's set - aside hierarchy received the second highest volume of dollars; $ 461 million were awarded through the general small business set - aside. These data illustrate two factors. First, the <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)" title="distributional equity/distributions">procurement</span> hierarchy tends to screen out contracting opportunities for programs lower on the hierarchy.

<p>VA augmented its PACT Act Performance Dashboard to include a quarterly demographic supplement that includes demographics analyses for key metrics beginning with gender, race / ethnicity and age, that will provide insights to help ensure VA's implementation of the <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">law</span> serves all Veterans. In October 2021, VA enhanced the quarterly VA - Wide Trust Survey to capture voluntary, self - reported expanded demographic options for race, ethnicity, gender identity and sexual orientation to identify trust scores for underserved populations. These metrics are reported each quarter as part of VA's I * DEA agency priority goal (APG) for the FY 2022 - 2023 cycle and from quarter 1 of FY 2022 through quarter 3 of FY 2023, statistically significant increases in trust occurred across 10 of the 26 enhanced demographic domains. When comparing quarter 3 of FY 2022 trust scores with quarter 3 of FY 2023 trust scores, VA saw statistically significant increases across 19 of the 26 domains. See Appendix, VA - Wide Trust Scores: I * DEA APG, quarter 1 of FY 2022 through quarter 3 of FY 2023. The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) hosted 12 symposia to enhance outreach to rural communities, minority Veterans and women Veterans.

This <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">policy</span> update was not directly related to the VA's EJ Strategic Plan, but rather part of larger planning in which environmental justice was prioritized.

<p>VA proposed modifications to the regulatory framework for eligibility determinations involving Veterans ' military discharges that may be considered " " dishonorable " " for VA benefit eligibility purposes. The proposed revision of 38 C.F.R. § 3.12, Update and Clarify Regulatory Bars to Benefits Based on Character of Discharge, addresses disparities related to Veteran status and eligibility determination that are a major issue for homeless Veterans as well as LGBTQ + and other minority Veterans. While rulemaking is still ongoing, VA highlights the following public - facing efforts to hear concerns from underrepresented groups: July 2020: Published a proposed <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">rule</span> in the Federal Register to amend 38 C.F.R. § 3.12 (85 FR 41471) Update and Clarify Regulatory Bars to Benefits Based on Character of Discharge; September 2021: Published a Request for Information (RFI) to the Federal Register for additional public commentary on aspects of the proposed <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">regulation</span> (86 FR 50513) Discharge; and Held listening sessions in October 2021. VA published a request for information (RFI) on June 20, 2023, for the public to provide data and information on minority and historically underserved Veterans. Historically underserved Veterans includes racial and ethnic minorities (Asian American; Black or African American; Hispanic / Latino; Native American, including American Indian, Alaskan Native and Native Hawaiian; or Pacific - Islander American); LGBTQ + individuals; those determined to be underserved based on their religious beliefs and practices; those with language barriers or without citizenship status; and those in rural areas and on tribal lands. The Center for Minority Veterans (CMV) will use this input to improve outreach, education, engagement, enrollment, advocacy and <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> programs for minority and underserved Veterans. </p></article>

<p>The PACT Act is the largest health care and benefit expansion in VA history. This <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">law</span> helps provide generations of Veterans (Vietnam era, Gulf War era and Post 9 / 11 era) with benefits and health care for exposure to burn pits, Agent Orange and other toxic substances. To provide insights to help ensure that implementation of the <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">law</span> leads to equitable outcomes for all Veterans, VA has: Supplemented its PACT Act performance dashboard to include demographics such as gender, race / ethnicity and age; Translated PACT ACT fact sheets into 13 languages, with additional languages in <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">process</span>, improving <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" title="procedural equity">access</span> for Veterans, their families, caregivers and survivors with preferred languages other than English; Launched VA.gov / PACT, a comprehensive public - facing resource for Veterans and their families, caregivers and survivors; Trained employees on the new <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3)" title="structural equity">law</span>, resulting in being able to reach more Veterans; and Used PACT Act authorities to improve national rural recruitment and hiring for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA); enhance the ability of VA to hire and retain staff, including health care providers, recent graduates and housekeeping aides; offer higher salaries, awards and bonuses to critical staff; and increase the amount of student loan repayment employees can receive. These new authorities resulted in nearly a 12,000 net increase of VA employees - over 7,600 of which were clinical occupations. These additional staff assisted in providing services to nearly 122,000 new enrollees and processing of over 900,000 claims. </p></article>
